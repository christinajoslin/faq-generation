Our website contains several images that have to be generated in Workbench and then are uploaded to a special directory in Data Depot - /depot/hall556/www - where it can be linked to and accessed by our website and those using our website. This setup has worked fine for several years, however, we just began having issues accessing these images. When trying to open up one of these images, you get the error shown in the image below.

If you would like to continue use Workbench, you might want to contact the group manager, name Lynelle name, to re-subscribe Workbench service. Let me know if you have further questions.

It looks like you also have access to name, can you please try login to name as well? It is sounds like a network latency issue to me. If your network is slow or unstable, the approval response from your phone might not be received by the server in time, causing it to re-prompt for authentication. If you have any other wifi sources available, please try connect to other network and see if problem still there. Also, please make sure that you are using the latest versions of SecureCRT and WinSCP, as older versions might have compatibility issues with the server's authentication system. Best, name  Hi name seems to work fine. Bell is really the main cluster I have had issues with. I just upgraded to the latest SecureCRT and WinSCP and things work better, but I did get a since instance of ""Keyboard-interactive authentication with the SSH2 server failed"" when trying to log into Bell.

13606,1923870,Dedicated Quantum Science Center Cluster Node,2023-06-16,2023-07-13,"Hello! My name is name. I am a Ph.D. candidate working with Prof. Sabre Kais, name, Sasha Boltasseva, and Vlad Shalaev. Our groups run a lot of machine learning workloads and so we want to setup a dedicated Gilbreth node to persistently host a server software called ClearML. We are apart of a larger organization known as the Quantum Science Center hosted by Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Our goal would be to open this node to other members of the QSC if possible. How can we get that process started? Thank you! -name Hi name, Thank you for contacting us. There are couple of things here. First of all, it is possible to collaborate with people outside of Purdue and share the Purdue resources with them but they need to have a valid Purdue account. There is a process call R4P (Request for Privilege) which is used for requesting accounts for people out side of Purdue. Any Purdue faculty should be able to request for the collaborators. Documentation on the process can be found here: https://www.purdue.edu/hr/buspur/supportingDocs/r4pRequestorInstructions.pdf Once the process is done, they can be added to any Purdue resources by PIs. Secondly, you mentioned about ""setup a dedicated Gilbreth node to persistently host a server software"". Please note that current Gilbreth GPU products on our purchase page ""https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/orders/products?search=gilbreth&category=22&restricteddata=*&public=1"" are sold with ""high-priority scheduling"" instead of real ""dedicated"" GPU hardware. i.e. After purchase, your group will have an ""exclusive"" owner queue (with X GPUs). But it does not mean ""exclusive"" hardware (i.e. GPUs are not always sitting IDLE only for your group). Instead, your group will have higher priorities to use these amount of GPUs than others. You may see wording like ""dedicated GPU"" on our product page before but that was not precise and has been modified now. However, if you are really interested in the real dedicated GPU hardware (i.e. GPUs setup up for your group use only), we can have move conversations about it and discuss about possible solutions. Besides of Gilbreth, we have another platform called Geddes which is a Community Composable Platform optimized for composable, cloud-like workflows that are complementary to the batch applications run on Community Clusters. Please take a look at the purchase page (https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/orders/products?category=39) and see if it is suitable for the workflow. Once the purchase has been made and R4P has been completed, your group can control the resources and add collaborators in to share those resources. Let me know if you need more information about those and we would be more than happy to help. Best regards, name Senior Computational Scientist Purdue Information Technology  Hello! Thank you for the response. We're looking into pricing and considering purchasing either of these nodes. What benefits does Geddes offer over Gilbreth? I am a little confused on the difference. We are looking for the easiest way to have our team to have a unified codebase and be able to submit jobs to the cluster regularly. What do you recommend? A custom Jupyter kernel? -name  Hi name, Geddes is a Community Composable Platform optimized for composable, cloud-like workflows that are complementary to the batch applications run on Community Clusters. So unlike Gilbreth where we have setup everything of the system centrally, you will need to bring your own container to Geddes to compose the entire workflow. The benefits of Geddes over Gilbreth is that it's much customized based on your needs which gives you more control. But that does require your own build. Take the Jupyter kernel for an example. On Geddes, you will need to build the system (e.g. Centos 7) then install anaconda and deploy your own Jupyter in a conda env. But on Gilbreth, we already have the system with anaconda and jupyter, you just need to create your own conda env with personal Jupyter kernel inside. The latter is much easier to use but the former allows you the full control of the entire system (e.g. you can control the system with 'sudo xxx' if you like). Hope it can explain the differences. So which platform to go totally depends on your needs and workflow. Let me know if you need to learn more about it.

This was initially for 5TB, then it was changed to 5TB for 3 yrs, and then 10TB for 3 yrs-- but this is on top of the existing 5TB renewal (which is the order you've created this ticket for).

Thanks, name, Yes, the Cancer Center and name Group are two completely separate spaces. My apologies for the confusion, but thank you for bringing this to my attention as it did bring to light something else. I have discovered that Order 11203 is part of the series of Orders that were transferred from your group to the Cancer Center in February of 2018. The space was appropriately transferred, but we neglected to update the group on it. I have fixed that. Here is the situation as it stands. You have new order 11027 for the name Group, which is now set up for 10TB for 3 years (just waiting on Business Office Approval). The other order, 11203, is actually a renewal for 5TB of Data Depot space for the Cancer Center. Do you want to increase this one as well, or just the new ""name"" order?

13616,1924292,Fortress permissions,2023-06-16,2023-06-27,"All, As I near retirement I am working to house my files on Fortress in a way that the remaining lab members can access them. I am utilizing the group directories, specifically /group/cstauffa under my name csteussy. However, the permissions for the files I am creating seem to ?often show a group of 'student' rather than cstauffa, and the permissions do not allow group access. A picture of my file listing is below. Would you please correct these permissions so my lab mates can get to my files? Also, I will be adding more files in the near future, so the defaults for my fortress login and file creation would do well to change. Thanks, Calvin (Nic) Steussy [cid:id-af6a-4724-9cdb-79332a9ed9b5] Nic, I believe your issue is due to the group you have in Purdue's accounting has you listed as being in group ""student, so that is how you are listed in Fortress's password file. In HSI, the default group is whatever it says in the password file, so new files are going to have group ""student"". You can change this default behavior by making this command the first command you run in an HSI session: newgrp cstauffa That will change your default group to cstauffa until the end of the session or you chnage it again. I have gone ahead and changed the groups on those files you mentioned. In the future, if you see any like that, since you are the owner and are in the cstauffa group. you can change the group in HSI yourself: chgrp cstauffa filename I hope that helps. Please let me know of further problems. name Senior Research Solutions Engineer  Thanks name. Appreciate the help. Another questions. If I move (mv filename filename) a file on fortress does that require the file to be read from tape and then re-written? Thanks again. Nic out  Hi Nic. A move name in the archive is totally a metadata name, so no tapes are involved. A copy does need the data portion as well, so it may require a tape mount/read. Hope that helps. name  Thanks name.

13627,1925619,Access to GPU servers,2023-06-19,2023-07-25,"We have lots of faculty wanting to access clusters of GPUs. Many are opting to buy their own servers with 4 or 8 GPUs. We want to encourage them to use RCAC clustsers if they fit their needs. I no longer have a clear picture of what is being offered. It appears Gilbreth and Anvil* are the only clusters that have significant numbers of GPUs. Our department has purchased one subscription to Gilbreth-H. The intent is to allow our users access to this single department queue to run one-off jobs, or trial jobs before purchasing their own node[s] or queues. Looking over the purchase options, I see the ones that mention GPUs say ""access to one <model> GPU"". Is this still the old model of getting a user priority access on that one GPU, but (subject to queue wait times) being able to request n GPUs for a job run? Or are they always limited to one GPU at a time. What should faculty be purchasing to have access to multiple GPUs for computation? name * Anvil is accessed through ACCESS and not direct purchase from RCAC. ///////////////////////////////////// name Academic IT Specialist Department of Computer Sciences Purdue University www.cs.purdue.edu/people/name he/his/him Hi name, Thank you for contacting us Gilbreth is our current GPU cluster. We sell it based on the type of GPUs (A10, A30 and A100). We have one year and 5 year subscription plans. For example, if they would like to buy four A100-80GB GPUs for 1 year, the price will be 4*$2200=$8800. And if they need buy one A100-80GB GPU for more than 3 years, we will recommend the 5 year plan, since $7000 will be cheaper than 4 year*$2200=$8800. Best, name  Is it the case that a single subscription -- subscription to a single A10 GPU -- only allows a user to request 1 GPU per queued job? I'm comparing this to the *CPU* model where a subscript to a single node still allows ""standby"" queue jobs of n nodes. name On 6/20/23 09:18, Purdue Customer Support wrote: > [Duplicate message snipped]  Hi name, Yes, it is same as the CPU model. They buy 1 GPU (or half CPU node), on their group's queue, they are only allowed to use 1 GPU (or half node) a time.

As I understand it, when running hyper-shell on a single name node (say I check out #SBATCH -N 1 -n 20) and I want to run 20 parallel tasks I would say: hyper-shell cluster tasks -o Taskfile.output -f Taskfile.failed -N 20 However, if I want to increase the # of tasks in parallel to 60 I would have to check out 3 nodes from name (e.g. #SBATCH -N 3 -n 60) but as I understood from your previous email -N 20 in the hyper-shell call is 20 tasks per node so this should not be increased to -N 60 is that correct?

Learn why this is important<https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification> Dear Sir or Madam, I faced a problem with running cases on Gilbreth several days ago. I got this error (first picture), and previously I successfully ran cases with this script (second picture) using cuda. Could you please help me what should I change in this script to run case? Thank you for your time! name Hi name, Can you tell me the job id of a failed job, and the job id of a successful one? Also, if it's okay with you I'd like to copy the dataset you used for the failed job to my own directory to try to duplicate the problem. Can you tell me what directory it is in? (or let me know if you would prefer I don't do that). You said you've seen this problem for several days - have all your runs failed since then, or are some succeeding? If all are failing now, can you tell me the approximate date the failures began? Thanks, Steve  Steve, Thank you for the answer! My last successful job is: Job_id=3591006 on 6.7.2023. And some successful jobs before 6.7.2023: Job_id=3588005, Job_id=3588006, Job_id=3588003. After 6.7.2023 I did not try to run anything till 6.11.2023. It seems that the problem started from Job_id=3595931 on 6.11.2023; some other failed jobs after 6.7.2023: Job_id=3600792, Job_id=3604532, Job_id=3607387, Job_id=26120521, Job_id=26121132. Yes, it is okay. One of such directories is /scratch/gilbreth/evorozhb/6_1_Closed channel kn7_10x4 timestep/ , I tried to run this particular case now and got the same error Job_id=3608087. This case was successfully run till 180 iterations, and now I tried to continue this case. Also, I want to note that maybe not all of the mentioned Job # are for this directory, as I have several directories with different cases to run. But all of my cases failed now with this error. name  Hi name, I don't have a solid answer yet but I've got something to try, and a request for more information from you. I believe the problem may be due to system software updates during the recent Gilbreth maintenance. I've built a new copy of libmetis.so but I'm having difficulty reproducing your Python environment. 1. Can you copy /scratch/gilbreth/name/libmetis.so into your directory space somewhere and point this line in your job script to it:export FRFS_METIS_LIBRARY_PATH=2. If that doesn't help, (or even if it does) can you give me the recipe you used to install frfs and create its python environment? Thanks, Steve  Hi Steve, Unfortunately, those steps do not help. I have attached the error. Also, I have attached the installation process for the software that I use (1-11 slides). What you are asking for, I suppose, it is 5,9,10 slides. Thank you! name  Hi name, Thanks! I'll try to recreate the entire environment and see what I can come up with. I don't know if explaining my thoughts will help you, but for what it's worth, I'm very confused by a failure in a function calling the munge library -- that is the simple encryption library used at the heart of the job scheduler for inter-node communication, and I can't think of any reason why your code would be caught up in that. I have similar thoughts about the 'mlx' device errors - those are the drivers for the Mellanox network hardware within the cluster. My assumption has been that something has changed in the system libraries when we updated some of the software (on June 7) and that causes the current problems. I had hoped that just rebuilding the metis library with the new environment would help. If I can build a complete environment identical to yours (but with all the python references in my own space) I'll try to trace execution through the whole process and see if I can see what's actually going on. Steve  Hi Steve! My colleague just sends me the message that ""in a job submission script remove srun command to execute the frfs solver. I removed the command, and the code is running again. It should simply be frfs run "" I tried this suggestion, and it works: simulation runs now. But we are not sure if it is the final solution or just a temporary solution. Thank you name  Hi name, That's great news, thanks! If you are running on a single core (the -n 1 in your script), it shouldn't make any difference. I don't know enough about your code to know whether it would help to run it with more tasks as an MPI job, which in this case is essentially what 'srun' would do.I've found a different workaround that involves the srun command, but I wouldn't recommend you stop your running job(s) to try it. My workaround is to add the option '--mpi=pmi2' to the srun command. (i.e. 'srun --mpi=pmi2 frfs run ...'). If the frfs package is written to use MPI, then running it that way with more cores might help speed it up, but I suspect since it's using Cuda and a GPU that MPI wouldn't help much if at all.

If so, this might be the reason. @bell-fe02:~ $ myquota kim3807 Type Location Size Limit Use Files Limit Use ============================================================================== home kim3807 25.0GB 25.0GB 100% - - - scratch bell 4KB 200.0TB 0.00% 0k 2,000k 0.00% depot name 55.5GB 100.0GB 56% - - - In this case, you might want to clear up some space on your HOME. To do so, you can open a terminal from your laptop, and type, ssh Then enter your boilerkeys, you will login on Bell. You can run 'ncdu' to see what eats your space, maybe some caches.

Learn why this is important<https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification> Good afternoon, I am name, a first-year Ph.D. student from Health Science school working in Dr. Hes (cc-d) lab. We are looking for a powerful computer to help us calculate finite element methods cases through commercial software CST. We didnt find this specific software on the provided software list. Can we install this software after purchasing the processors and GPUs? In addition, we are interested in the storage solution. Can we access the cluster storage through our own devices (not the Purdue IP devices)? I will be so grateful if you can provide any additional information about the overall system, as my advisor and I are new to Purdue, and we dont know much about RCAC. Thank you so much! Have a great day! name Hi name, Thanks for reaching out! Welcome to Purdue and RCAC! Yeah, we are happy to meet with your and Dr. He. I think we can setup a virtual meeting to talk about RCAC resources as well as software installations. Please feel free to let me know when is good for you. I can setup a Teams meeting. Cheers, --- name, PhD Sr. Computational Scientist RCAC Research Computing Purdue University  Hi name, Thank you so much! How about Thursday at 2 pm? Please let me know if that works for you. Best, name  Hi name, 2pm ET works for me. I just sent the Teams link to you and Dr. He. Talk to you this afternoon. Cheers, name  Dear name, Thank you so much for your time and professional introduction. I learned a lot from the meeting, and I think the project will go well with your help. Ive attached some documents regarding the CST operating system support, the GPU computing guide, and the Linux installation guide. However, the Linux installation guide comes from the year 2019, this is the newest one I can find, I will ask the sales for help. I didnt go through all of them, so I am unsure if these files could help us figure out the installation and license issues. Here is the web link for the CST software we want to use. https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/cst-studio-suite/<https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.3ds.com%2Fproducts-services%2Fsimulia%2Fproducts%2Fcst-studio-suite%2F&data=05%7C01%7CCentral-Incident%40purdue.edu%7Ced6334ac69114a78305808db73565f21%7C4130bd397c53419cb1e58758d6d63f21%7C0%7C0%7C638230587595107531%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=csB8uzQ95hWRslYdTJmfcXk%2FEKojpd7u%2B0XnXGAS0LI%3D&reserved=0> And the hardware requirement of CST https://www.3ds.com/support/hardware-and-software/simulia-system-information/cst-studio-suite-opera/cst-studio-suite/<https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.3ds.com%2Fsupport%2Fhardware-and-software%2Fsimulia-system-information%2Fcst-studio-suite-opera%2Fcst-studio-suite%2F&data=05%7C01%7CCentral-Incident%40purdue.edu%7Ced6334ac69114a78305808db73565f21%7C4130bd397c53419cb1e58758d6d63f21%7C0%7C0%7C638230587595107531%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ftjEPqQLKjqZ0OoXTpBDWLN1k2mA9k9%2BaSxP5F%2FMrNs%3D&reserved=0> Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you again! name  Hi name, Thanks for sharing this information. From the first glance, the installation will need at least 30GB space? This cannot fit into your HOME directory (only 25GB), if this is true, you will need a Data Depot space for this installation. I would dig more and get more information. We can discuss this later. Please keep me posted when your license is confirmed, then we can get started. Cheers, name  Hi name, Thank you so much for the information. Does this mean we should purchase the Data Depot space before we can get the free trial of the Gilbreth? The license should not be a problem since the shared license supports both Windows and Linux systems, I am still working on checking the license version since the Tesla A30 supports a version later than CST 2021 SP5. I will let you know when I get the feedback. Thank you so much! Have a nice weekend! name  Hi name, We can try to install this on your Scratch first and see if this can work, then we can move the installation to Depot later, so purchasing Depot is not in a hurry. I have discussed this with my colleagues yesterday. We checked the hardware requirements more carefully, and we might have some fitting problems respect to operating system. Gilbreth could probably run this software, but there is one important caveat, quote from CST website, ""The full list of supported operating system versions for CST STUDIO SUITE is available as FAQ 1404. This version of CST STUDIO SUITE is supported and continuously tested on RedHat Enterprise Linux 6.x and 7.x as well as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 11.4 and 12. Although CST can only guarantee compatibility on these specic distributions the software usually works on other Linux distributions as well and we know of working installations on e.g. CentOS 6.x, CentOS 7.x and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS"". Thus, Gilbreth's OS is not officially supported (we have Centos 7.9 on Gilbreth), but CST cites it as having working installations CentOS 7.x. That's an important thing to recognize because if installation goes wrong, CST will not provide support. As well, it seems there are various modes of name. We would be curious to know how you intend to interact with the software because that could also complicate things. We might need another meeting to discuss more details about this. I know this did not look like promising, and I am not sure if this would affect the license setup as well. Do you want to invite ECN people, the ones have CST license, to our next meeting? I would invite colleagues to join too. I am sure my colleagues would have more experience about license setup as well as hardware fitting knowledge. Cheers, name  Hi name, I appreciate the detailed, professional insights you and your team have shared. To be honest, I'm somewhat unfamiliar with the problem at hand, but I plan to reach out to CST's sales group for assistance. I'll also contact their technic support to see if they can provide further insight. In addition, I will be inviting a senior Ph.D. student who manages all of that lab's licenses to participate in our meeting. But it seems like his schedule is packed, I haven't heard from him for a few days. Rest assured, I'll update you as soon as I hear from him. Regarding the software interaction, I believe we can deprioritize this for now. It would indeed be excellent if we could replicate the interface from the Windows version. However, I'm perfectly cool with learning how to use Linux commands to manage my simulations. Primarily, I hope for the software to operate seamlessly, so the interaction aspect isn't a major concern at this point. In closing, I would like to thank you and your team for your support. I believe that we can figure it out. Best regards, name  Hi name, I got feedback from CST. Here is a copy of that email. Best, name Hi name, CentOS 7.9 IS supported (CentOS 7.X where X is a number that can be also 9). We have confirmed successful installations of CST 2021, 2022 and 2023 on CentOS 7.94.

I did bring the interactive-name desire to my colleagues, we would say we have a way to make the software look like the one on Windows, it is called interactive desktop. I think as long as we figure out the installation on Gilbreth, we can work on the interactive desktop part to make you feel easier to use this and leave tons of linux commands behind. We need to work on it to find out how to deploy CST as an interactive desktop. So first thing first, we need to figure out how to install CST on Gilbreth. Do you mind to ask CST support where to find the Linux installation guide they mentioned? Let me know when you want to have a meeting to discuss this.

We have Negishi on name, which is like Bell cluster but with newer hardwares. Gilbreth is also on name as you know. Have you talked to CST support to figure out if your work need GPU? Cheers, name  Hi name, We got information from CST support. The GPU could speed up our simulation but requires an additional token for each GPU device. The software will ask for tokens during the GPU acceleration and release them after calculation, so the tokens are not bonded with a physical device. Fortunately, Prof. name had paid for those tokens, and he is so generous that he allowed us to use them. So, we want to use the same cluster as Prof. Kildishevs group used, which I believe is Gilbreth. However, it will be less risky if you can help us to check if their lab run CST on Gilbreth in case we get new problems. Thank you so much! Best, name  Hi name, Thanks for letting me know. I am not sure how to check if they run CST on Gilbreth, let me ask Steve about this. The other thing is, this ticket system would be inactive next week.

13655,1927281,Power Shut down in RHPH,2023-06-21,2023-07-07,"Hi there, I am running a name job in gilbreth. I got an email that power will be shut down on my lab building(RHPH) this Thursday morning. Will this affect my job on gilbreth? Thank you Best, name lab Hi name, Thanks for reaching out! If you are using OnDemand for an interactive job, and your own computer gets disconnected, yes, your job would abort. If you are using OnDemand/terminal for a bash job, and your own computer gets disconnected, no, your job will not be affected. If you are not familiar with interactive job and bash job, you might want to check our Cluster 201 trainings to learn more about them and how to submit them. https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/training/clusters201 Hope this helps, --- name, PhD Sr. Computational Scientist RCAC Research Computing Purdue University  Hi name, We noticed you are running jobs on front-end node on Gilbreth? We would suggest to cancel that job or we will cancel it. Because front end nodes are not for doing heavy computations, it was shared by all Gilbreth users. PID USER PR name VIRT RES SHR S %CPU %MEM TIME+ COMMAND 11793 thapa5 39 19 9266760 1.5g 338404 R 96.4 0.3 3030:42 gdesmond You should submit your job to computing nodes. If you do not know how to do it, we have user guide and trainings to reference. https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/gilbreth/run https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/training Let me know if you have questions. name  Hi name, To reiterate what my colleague Dr. name said, you definitely do not want running simulations on cluster login nodes (front-ends), because they are shared between all cluster users, there are watchdogs that can throttle and even terminate large and/or long-running tasks, and overall performance on login nodes is a lot lower than what you could expect on compute nodes dedicated to your jobs. So you should definitely move your workflow into the compute queue. For the power outage question, in general, name, Maestro and other components running on the cluster will not be affected by power outage in RHPH (because Gilbreth itself is not going down). However, what _could_ be affected are two things: 1) Maestro or any component or job manager running *on a workstation in RHPH*. That is, if you configured Schrodinger hosts on your local workstation to submit to Gilbreth queues, the submissions will work fine, the tasks will be running fine, but local Maestro would be terminated by the power outage, so it may or may not be able to pick up the status of running jobs after the restart. I do not know Schrodinger well enough, so not fully sure what would happen. But the tasks themselves will continue to run in this scenario. 2) If you were launching things in a specific type of interactive job. Not all interactive jobs, but specifically, if you were using direct SSH to the cluster from your local workstation, and then launched things from that SSH session, all launched processes will likely disappear if that SSH session gets terminated (when the local workstation disconnects due to reboot). I suspect you were using Thinlinc or OnDemand gateway to launch your tasks (rather than a direct SSH... Thinlinc was what I have described in a document I have previously shared with your lab). In this case your tasks will likely be unaffected (Thinlinc desktop session resides on a cluster, so rebooting local workstation disconnects local client from the session, but the the session stays alive and the client can then reconnect to it). So all in all, looks like you are most likely safe in terms of power outage, but not quite there in terms of running heavy science on cluster login nodes. Several ways to achieve it, but basically, if you are using command line to launch your simulations, you'd just need to put those commands into a script and sbatch it (see links that name has shared earlier). And if you are using Maestro in Thinlinc, then either a) start an interactive job and launch Maestro inside it (and then use 'localhost' Schrodinger host), or b) launch Maestro on the login node and then use one of the Gilbreth-*** Schrodinger hosts. Thanks, name P.S. Looking at 'slist' output for your account, I do not see you being part of any queues on Gilbreth - and that's a fundamental problem. You might want to talk to Prof. name about adding you to her 'li4578-k' queue. From what I can see, she has not done it yet (your request to join is still pending in the system). Please ask her to grant you access you her Gilbreth queue, and you would be all set. -- name Rosen Center for Advanced Computing (RCAC)  hi name, Do you have further questions?

13662,1927581,Performance issues with website hosted through Geddes,2023-06-22,2023-07-10,"Good morning, Our office, the Midwestern Regional Climate Center (MRCC), has a new website (mrcc.geddes.rcac.purdue.edu) that's in the final stages of development and is being hosted on Geddes. We've had issues lately with the performance of our website. Pages take forever to load and, at times, result in timeout errors. We've done some investigating on our end, but we haven't been able to discover the source of the issues much less find a solution. Is this something you guys can assist us with? Best, name Senior Research Analyst / Applications Manager Midwestern Regional Climate Center and the Indiana State Climate Office Phone: Email: <mailto: [cid:id]<https://mrcc.purdue.edu/> Hi name, Can you send some endpoints where you see this issue? Are some endpoints worse than others? We can try some testing on them and see if we can reproduce and troubleshoot. Thanks, -name  Hi name, Sorry Im just now getting back to you. The only consistent pattern were seeing is that there seems to be a significant degradation in performance when using our media manager thats built into the site. name helped put together the site, and hes looking into the media manager itself to see if perhaps the process of parsing through all those images is bogging down the server, but when I take a look at the overall activity of the server, it doesnt seem to be running low on ram or cpu, so I dont know why that would impact other systems. It also seems like, even after everyones done using the media manager, the site continues to crawl for minutes or even hours after as if theres a process or request thats name. Im admittedly quite inexperienced with the web stuff, so I have no clue if that makes any sense. Like I said, name has been helping us diagnose the media manager side of things. So if you want to reach out to him, he might be able to offer some insight into that side of things. I was just curious if there was something else going on that might also be causing trouble. Weve had issues with spontaneous website performance issues in the past that werent related to the media manager. Im not sure if any of that was at all helpful. But please let me know if theres any other information I can provide to help. Thanks so much, name Senior Research Analyst / Applications Manager Midwestern Regional Climate Center and the Indiana State Climate Office Phone: Email: <mailto: [cid:id]<https://mrcc.purdue.edu/>  Hi name, Something thing I found when investigating another issue was that one of the Geddes nodes had an issue that caused it to be very unresponsive. I saw there were a few mrcc pods on this node. I drained the node and your pods are running elsewhere now. Perhaps the issue is better now? If it still is running slowly let me know and we can continue to investigate. Thanks, -name  Hi name, Weve certainly seen improvements recently, so it seems this mustve done the trick! Well let you know if we notice any issues come back.

13665,1928064,Negishi question,2023-06-22,2023-08-04,"Some people who received this message don't often get email from . Learn why this is important<https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification> Hello I just got set up on Negishi to do Sentaurus Device simulations, and Ive been trying to figure out how to patch the Sentaurus Workbench tool with the SLURM queue system. I have been able to directly launch device simulations via SLURM from the command line, but not yet from SWB. Sentaurus has a limited set of queue systems that it supports, and SLURM is not one of them. However, it does support LSF and I found some perl code that patches LSF to SLURM. Ive had some limited success using this code, but I ran into an issue that might be worth having someone check on. I tried to run a simple job, and it seemed to get submitted and finish successfully, but some process that gets launched in the process is writing to a log file (glog.txt) long after the job is complete. I thought at first SWB was polling to see if the job was done, but the log file continues to be written to after quitting SWB, closing the terminal window, and logging off thinlinc. The process must be running on the cluster rather than on the front-end. I changed the name of the log file, and the original file was not regenerated, so perhaps that stopped the process, but Im concerned that Im generating some zombie processes that dont get killed appropriately. Two questions: 1. Can you check to make sure there are no zombie processes running on the cluster associated with my account? 2. Is there any way for me to ensure no zombie processes are running and / or kill all processes associated with my account, whether on the front-end or on the cluster? Thanks! name Hi name, Thank you for contacting us! I checked all your jobs on the computing nodes, there is no remaining process. Slurm would kill anything on compute nodes after job is finished. But there are some remaining processes on frontends that continue writing outputs to your log files. glog.txt seems to be a log tracking the status of swb. So as long as swb is running, the log will keep growing. Once you changed the name of your log file, the remaining processes cannot find the path, so it will stop writing. You can run this command ""pdsh -R ssh -g login ps -u morisett | grep swb"" to see the remaining processes on frontends: login02: 664703 pts/99 00:04:34 swb login02: 785691 pts/112 00:00:24 swb login06: 3364467 ? 00:00:10 swblm login04: 2606391 ? 00:00:05 swb login04: 2616317 ? 00:00:00 swb login05: 3274561 ? 00:00:13 swblm You can ssh to these login nodes and kill your remaining processes. To avoid have remaining processes on the login nodes in the future, instead of submitting jobs inside the Sentaurus, you can try to generate a batch job submitting script, put the commands into that script and submit it using sbatch script. So that you will have an isolated job environment and once job finished, everything will be killed. Best, name  Hi name - Thanks, this is really helpful! The SWB front end calls some helper apps (gsub and gjob) that actually perform the job submission and monitoring, and I figured out that it was one of these processes that was writing to the log file. Thats why killing swb didnt kill the writing to the log file, but I dont understand why logging out of the thinlinc session didnt kill them all. Perhaps they were called from within swb with something like nohup so they run independently of the login session. Thanks for the pdsh command idea - I never would have come up with that! As far as I know, Im currently logged out of all thinlinc sessions and logged in via only one terminal window on my local machine. However, I see the following when I dont do the grep. The red lines appear to be related to the pdsh command, but it looks like I have a bunch of zombie processes (blue) that need to be cleaned up, including one thinlinc session (pink) that is still out there! Is there a way to use a similar command to kill all processes associated with my login? I went through login00-07 one at a time and did a killall -u morisett to clean things up. Also, am I correct that if I do a 'squeue -u morisett and get no results that I dont have any zombie processes running on the cluster? Just wanting to make sure I learn to be a well behaved community member! :) I have figured out how to use sbatch directly to launch sentaurus processes, but I was hoping to be able to use SWB to manage things, because it keeps track of what experiments have been run, dependencies between them, and the extraction of results. Managing all this on a large design-of-experiments set without SWB would be a pain The LSF / SLURM patch scripts Im using are actually part of the SLURM distribution on GitHub, but theyre clearly not a clean drop-in wrapper. I have already had to modify them to add some options that werent already supported. Are you aware of any other options for patching between software like SWB that support only specific queuing systems and SLURM? The options in SWB are LSF, SGE, Torque (TM), and RTDA.

But I do not think it works. I am wondering if you are available to have a virtual meeting about this. I saw there are some folders and files you want to change permission and it is hard for me to locate them (especially files, I cannot scan all the files on depot/jheim to find those files). So it is better to have a meeting, then you can point which folder/file is the target. You can register one of our virtual coffee hour sessions or we can schedule a personal meeting. To register coffee hour consultation, You can go to https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/coffee Or let me know you want to meet at another time rather than coffee hour time.

Hi name, Oh, there must be some miscommunication here. We cannot use your code to change permissions, in this way it did not work. Because you code include sudo act which we should be very very careful.

13671,1928836,Increasing the 24 GPU Limit,2023-06-23,2023-07-10,"Hello RCAC, I am politely and professionally asking you to consider lifting the limit of 24 GPUs per user in the standby queue on Gilbreth. I am you to consider a 48 or 96 GPU limit instead. The impact to Gilbreth appears minimal. Many GPUs seem to remain idle. All processes would still only be permitted to run 4-hours at a time. From what I understand, the user experience would be almost unchanged. The impact to me would be great. I am late in my degree (starting year 6), and my future career depends almost entirely on achieving a state-of-the-art result to sell my research, and this require an architecture search. Each process requires 4 GPUs, so 48 or 96 GPUs allows me to explore 12 or 24 different configurations simultaneously. This decreases my wait time by a factor of 2 or 4. Concretely, I could do in 3 months which currently takes 1 year. Purdue is famously late to using GPUs, and our resources are still significantly more constrained that other research groups. Purdue purchased/installed the bulk of our good GPUs this spring, over a decade after the major result in deep learning (circa 2012). I've had to build my own computer system because Purdue is slow to adapt new technology. I feel Purdue's slow adaption of GPUs explains why Purdue has zero research groups who have achieved a state-of-the-art result on a standard benchmark. Please consider, if only temporarily, allowing users to utilize the recent upgrades more fully. Your team controls this policy, and the impact on my future is significant. Thank you for considering. Best, name College of Electrical and Computer Engineering Purdue University, Doctoral Student  Hi name, Thank you for contacting us. Per your request, we had another discussion today. I don't want to disappoint you but we cannot fulfill your request at the moment.

I will close this ticket for now but you are very welcome to browser our ""Science Highlights"" (https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/news/science) for the ""state-of-art"" research carried out on our clusters. Best regards, name Senior Computational Scientist Purdue Information Technology  Hello name, Would it be possible to have a more verbose discussion? Maybe we can meet via Zoom?

Best regards, name Senior Computational Scientist Purdue Information Technology First Customer Note:  Hello RCAC, I am politely and professionally asking you to consider lifting the limit of 24 GPUs per user in the standby queue on Gilbreth. I am you to consider a 48 or 96 GPU limit instead. The impact to Gilbreth appears minimal. Many GPUs seem to remain idle. All processes would still only be permitted to run 4-hours at a time. From what I understand, the user experience would be almost unchanged. The impact to me would be great. I am late in my degree (starting year 6), and my future career depends almost entirely on achieving a state-of-the-art result to sell my research, and this require an architecture search. Each process requires 4 GPUs, so 48 or 96 GPUs allows me to explore 12 or 24 different configurations simultaneously. This decreases my wait time by a factor of 2 or 4. Concretely, I could do in 3 months which currently takes 1 year. Purdue is famously late to using GPUs, and our resources are still significantly more constrained that other research groups. Purdue purchased/installed the bulk of our good GPUs this spring, over a decade after the major result in deep learning (circa 2012). I've had to build my own computer system because Purdue is slow to adapt new technology. I feel Purdue's slow adaption of GPUs explains why Purdue has zero research groups who have achieved a state-of-the-art result on a standard benchmark. Please consider, if only temporarily, allowing users to utilize the recent upgrades more fully. Your team controls this policy, and the impact on my future is significant. Thank you for considering.

I am only asking since this information has a huge impact on my future. I appreciate your continued thoughtful comments. I am trying to understand why users can not be allocated more resources, and I wonder if my resource usage estimate needs improvement. I am attaching a screenshot of my ""sinfo"" command using the ""%C"" flag to count the number of active/inactive CPUs. I understand GPUs are the resource I am interested in allocating, but I see many inactive CPUs in the attached screenshot. I appreciate your help understanding this better.

Learn why this is important<https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification> Hi Team, Can we request to update the maximum number of cores to 64 from 32 for our labs queue (bera89-k)? Our machine is on K sub cluster. Via the Standby queue, we see that there some machine on the K sub cluster that have 64 cores. But we cannot access them via the bera89-k queue because of strict user core size policies that are there in the back end. Currently we are running a code base that requires us to us to have a large number of CPU workers for performance. bera89-i only allows 32 cores and not 64 cores on cluster K sinteractive -A bera89-k --mem=120G --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=32 --gpus-per-node=1 --constraint=K --time=0-03:00:00 nproc 32 hostname sinteractive -A bera89-k --mem=120G --ntasks=2 --cpus-per-task=32 --gpus-per-node=1 --constraint=K --time=0-03:00:00 salloc: error: QOSGrpCpuLimit salloc: error: Job submit/allocate failed: Job violates accounting/QOS policy (job submit limit, user's size and/or time limits) Using standby queue to request 64 core cluster K sinteractive -A standby --mem=120G --ntasks=2 --cpus-per-task=32 --gpus-per-node=1 --constraint=K --time=0-03:00:00 nproc 64 hostname gilbreth-k014.rcac.purdue.edu (The machine has a single GPU only) regards name Hi name, Thank you for contacting us. Please note that each Gilbreth-K node is equipped with 64 cores and 2 GPUs (you can check with 'sfeatures' command). The reason that you cannot request for more than 32 cores from bera89-k queue is that your group only purchased one A100-80G GPU on Gilbreth-K, which is half node (32 cores). We set this limitation via QOS (Quality of Service), you can also check it with 'sacctmgr show qos bera89-k-default format=name%30,grptres%25'. We don't have such QOS limitation on standby queue so you are able to request for 64 cores with 1 GPU on a K node. Actually, this will allocate one entire K node (although only 1 GPU was used) which will prevent other users from using resources on the same node. Hope this can explain the situation. Let me know if you have further questions.

Thank you, name Graduate Student Purdue University Department of Horticulture & Landscape Architecture Horticulture Building, 625 Agriculture Mall Drive West Lafayette, IN 47907-2010  Hi, In general if you want to copy files/folders from source to destination, you can use 'cp -r /location/source/files /location/destination' ('-r' is used for folders). So for you questions: 1) copy data in jwisecav and keep it secreet form others inn that cluster as the data originnally belonngs to dr hirst A: Note that /depot space is a group shared space so you have access because you were added into that group. You can only copy files out from the depot space if the files' owner is you or they are group readable. 2) can i copy my data in jwisecav? A: Similar to 1), it depends on the data permission in jwisecav. If it's 'your data' (you're the owner) or group readable, you can copy it out of the space. 3) how can i copy it in my scratch A: If you want to copy data to '/scratch/name/jdanao/data', you need to run something like: 'cp -r /source/files /scratch/name/jdanao/data'.

Thanks, JL  Hi, Because Bell GPUs are AMD ones, so no you cannot use CUDA on Bell GPUs. Instead we have ROCm runtime. Please go to our User Guide (https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/bell/run/examples/apps/learning) and check how you can use /build your own machine learning workflows there.

I checked your account on Gilbreth, everything looks fine, except your HOME is about to be full, I think this is the reason ThinLinc keeps disconnecting. You can login Gilbreth using 'ssh' at a terminal and clean up some space, then your ThinLinc should work. You can run 'ncdu' command at your HOME to see what eats your space. Just in case, you are not familiar about ssh usage, here is how. You can search terminal from your computer if you do not have a ssh client, either Windows or Mac IOS. Then type the below command and put into your Purdue login password, then you can login into Gilbreth.

We detected a rapid sweep of file access time updates consistent with blanket touching of all or part of your scratch directory in an attempt to circumvent purging. Specifically, for the second time, you have run your purge avoidance script, ""refresh_file.py"". This is a clear and obvious violation of our acceptable use policy. The scratch filesystems are for limited-duration, high-performance storage of data for running jobs or workflows and are explicitly not intended to be used as a long-term storage. Doing so, or engaging in measures to circumvent purging, adversely affects all users of the system and our ability to provide such liberal quotas. Please review the scratch purge<https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/policies/scratchpurge> and resource usage<https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/policies/resourceuse> policies. Immediately cease this behavior and clear any unused data where possible. If necessary, consult our user guides and training material on archiving data and job outputs to the tape archive (Fortress). If these files must be available in perpetuity on a mounted filesystem, capacity on Data Depot is available for purchase. We have CCd the PI on your allocation to notify them of this violation and our continued efforts to inform you of our policy.

I would like to setup a meeting for us to discuss your needs and what sort of work-around we can provide. Lot's of folks on Gilbreth have a similar request. I think it really depends on what you're trying to do, but assuming you decompress (.tar instead of .tar.gz), I can guarantee that we can get higher performance operating on the one file than having 20M small files in directories. The issue is not just that we cannot support everyone having 20M inodes on the file system, but also the latency bottleneck in making per-file network requests on 20M small files in the training set.

Sorry for the confusion. Regards, name  Hello name, Sorry for the delay, as I said when we spoke last I have been away at a conference and am getting back to things this week. To answer your immediate follow-up question; we've given people temporary bumps to their quota by 2-4M files but never 20M+ and I do not think we will satisfy this request. I want to clarify from your most recent follow-up, using a .tar.gz archive would indeed be slow because that is gzip compressed at the archive level, so to traverse the archive and pull out individual files, one must decompress the entire thing as it goes along to find the positions to seek to (that is just the nature of how .TAR is structured). You need to name-compress the archive and have it be a raw .tar file (note the missing .gz from the compression). You must also keep in mind that the initial start-up time may be a few minutes while it reads the file (much faster than gzip however because we aren't decompressing anything).Over the past few days I've gotten an alternative approach working using the entire ImageNet dataset (13M+ files) where you would not need to make any code changes. You can pack the data files into a single .squashfs image file (not unlike an archive format - see mksquashfs command). Instead of making changes to your code, you would containerize it using singularity/apptainer (think Docker) and mount the .squashfs image into the container as a local directory. Your code would see it as a normal directory as you are trying to achieve now. In either case, I'm happy to discuss these approaches more with you. We need to migrate this issue to the new ticketing system because Footprints is being decommissioned. Please send another message to and it should open a ticket in the new system where we can continue our conversation.

13701,1931634,Question about data backups,2023-06-27,2023-07-21,"Hi RCAC Team, Nick (CCed) is working through a potential project with a company and they have an interesting request. Their data sharing agreement allows us to store the data for 1 year, but after that time they require destruction (and verification of the destruction) of both the current data and any backups. Im not as worried about clearing out the data that would be currently hosted on Anvil, but I know removing that many backups wouldnt be doable since its an all or nothing deletion. Is there a way that we could exclude the specific directory from the automated backup process? We wanted to follow up with you to learn more.

After discussion within team, we do not think we do any backups of Anvil project spaces. We do snapshots on a schedule but these are not backups (and would eventually expire). Please check this page for more information. NOTE: Full schedule keeps nightly snapshots for 7 days, name snapshots for 3 weeks, and monthly snapshots for 2 months. https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/anvil/storage/filesystems Whether it is possible to nuke snapshots for a single subdirectory, would be a question. But we highly doubt it'd be possible, so our guess would be that snapshots of that data which were deleted would continue to live on for the next 2 month. About opting out the snapshots schedule, we need to talk to our storage experts to confirm our guess. Hope this helps, name  Hi name, No worries! Thank you for digging in for more information. Based on that I think we should be OK as is. The vendor has a requirement that the data be deleted after 90 days, but with the information below I think the longest lived snapshot would be 60 days.

I've shared this ticket with our scientists who have expertise in Gaussian. They would be in touch with you soon. Thanks, name  Hi Shri, Thank you for reaching out! I am currently traveling on vacation until July 4th, so I'll just chime in with my initial thoughts and then will leave you in my colleagues' capable hands. First of all, please do not use name's user guide on Gilbreth. While our clusters have a lot in common, they are significantly different from each other, so I'd suggest always using the right user guide as reference (https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/gilbreth/run/examples/apps/gaussian) That said, it does look like our deployed 'subg16' script for the 'gaussian16/B.01-gpu' module on Gilbreth has a bug, and it passes an incorrect resource selection argument to the underlying sbatch command. From a quick glance, I have a feeling this may require somewhat of an investigation and re-work (@RCAC-ers - I am not sure how, but suspect an incorrect version of the wrapper crept into this installation). This might take us some time to untangle. In the interim... one option would be to use the 'rung16' wrapper instead (this is what 'subg16' uses internally anyways, so it's just the matter of calling it properly). The simplest invocation could leverage sbatch's built-in '--wrap' functionality: module load gaussian16/B01-gpu sbatch -N1 -n11 --gres=gpu:1 -A dflaher-h --time 24:00:00 --wrap=""rung16 AC1test"" (basically, you specify the necessary job parameters, and then '--wrap' flag at the end tells sbatch to generate a tiny submission script encompassing the command you want to execute). Note the quotes around the argument to the '--wrap' flag, they are important. This should work thanks to Slurm magic. Alternatively, you could use a full-blown batch job submission that calls Gaussian directly (see the very last example on the above user guide page). Thanks, name P.S. As a side note, note the '-n11' in my example above. This is important - your 'dflaher-h' queue on Gilbreth is anchored on H-subcluster nodes, and you only purchased 1 GPU (i.e. 1/3 of a full node, i.e. 11 CPU cores out of 32 total per node). So any request for more resources than this would either throw an error or leave the job waiting in the queue indefinitely. You _can_ get access to more resources than that, but only if you specify standby queue instead ('-A standby')... but remember that standby jobs are limited to at most 4 hours of walltime. -- name Rosen Center for Advanced Computing (RCAC)  Hi Shri, Do you have further questions? If not, I would tentative to mark this ticket as resolved. Thanks again for contact us! Please feel free to reach out if you have any question in the future!

I just took a look at your Data Depot space and noticed that the /depot/awthomps/apps folder is only readable but not writable to members in the awthomps-apps Unix group.

Hi name, I am not sure if there were any permission discrepancies in /depot/awthomps/apps that enabled you to write there. Nevertheless, our web developer just changed the permission settings of /depot/awthomps/apps. Members in the awthomps-apps Unix group should have write access now.

13716,1933059,Cluster parallel computing with Matlab using parfor,2023-06-28,2023-07-25,"Hello, I am trying to speed up my existing (serial) Matlab code by performing some of the tasks in parallel form, across multiple processors. However, I am not sure how to do this correctly. My code calculates the power spectrum of certain quantities on a surface (with 171045 nodes), over a time series of about 700,000 time steps. The data has to be read into memory from existing data files (saved at each time step), before the spectra can be calculated. To reduce the memory requirements of the job, I have modified the serial code to split up the domain into smaller groups of nodes, and perform the necessary operations for each group (one at a time). Because the most time-consuming name is the reading of the raw data from the different time steps into memory, I have opted to use a parfor-loop to parallelize this step. So, the pseudo-code is as follows: 1. Start Matlab script 2. Split up domain into groups of nodes 3. for each group: 3.1. parfor each time step: 3.1.1. open data file corresponding to the time step 3.1.2. store data from selected nodes into main data array 3.2. Calculate spectra using the main data array 3.3. Write spectra data into output file (for each group; I have a separate script to combine all the data from the different groups) 4. End Matlab script I have split the domain such that each group requires no more than 200 Gb worth of data to be read into memory. 3 compute nodes on name should provide sufficient memory for the job. I plan to submit a slurm job to run my Matlab script (described above), but without using an additional Matlab job submission script (which uses the Matlab ""batch"" function as described in https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/scholar/run/examples/apps/matlab/parfor), for simplicity. How should I define the cluster profile to setup the Matlab workers, such that the memory and cores across the 3 compute nodes will be utilized in the parfor loop? I have tried running the script without defining a cluster profile. That defaulted to the ""local"" profile of 12 Matlab workers on name. However, the job crashed while reading the data into memory (step 3.1. in the pseudo-code), without throwing any error in the slurm job output. I guess it failed because of insufficient memory, perhaps because it only had access to the memory on one compute node. Thank you Regards, name Hi name, Thank you for contacting us. I will need sometime to explore with it as current session in User Guide is kind of out-dated and may not work (but feel free to try it and implement it into your workflow). As a reference for the cluster profile manager, here is my settings fyi (note: you can download from https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/name/run/examples/apps/matlab/profile_manager, import it and modify). In 'Resource arguments for job submission.', I have '--nodes=2 --ntasks-per-node=24 --account=xxx --time=01:00:00'. Then I can validate and set this profile as 'default'. After the above set up, I can request for a parpool as much as 48 with 'parpool(48)'. I did not test how it works for the memory but the new job submitted by matlab parpool will get a total of two entire nodes and their total memory. Please go ahead and test if it works for you. Best regards, name Senior Computational Scientist Purdue Information Technology  Hi name, I tried setting up the cluster profile with the settings you mentioned, but it failed the validation tests (see attached pdf). The issue was probably with the arguments: ""--account=xxx --time=01:00:00"". Because after I removed those entries (i.e. resource arguments for job submission set as: ""--nodes=2 --ntasks-per-node=24""), the validation tests were completed successfully. With this working cluster profile, I got an interactive slurm job with 3 compute nodes on name, and ran my Matlab program with the modules gcc/6.3.0 and matlab/R2022a. However, when I ssh-ed separately into the compute nodes and looked at the cpu/memory utilization, it appeared that only the main compute node (batch host) was being utilized. The other two compute nodes were practically idle. The program eventually failed with the following error, Error using parallel.internal.cluster.ClusterParforEngine/getCompleteIntervals Task 25 failed execution while executing parfor loop Alternatively, with the ""local"" cluster profile, the same job (on 3 compute nodes on name) worked (it didn't fail). However, similar to the previous case, only the main compute node (batch host) was being utilized. The other two compute nodes were idle. Thanks Regards, name  Hi name, Sorry I should have been much clearer about the profile. It should be the account/queue name after '-- account=' (I.e. you should replace xxx with the actual account/queue you want to use). For example, if I want to request resources for 1 hour from 'standby', I need to put '--account=standby --nodes=2 --ntasks- per-node=24 --time=01:00:00'. You can change the parameters as needed. If you run with this profile (don't forget to set it as default), it (matlab) will actually submit a job named with 'jobx' (e.g. job3) with the specific resources request. Inside of this matlab workflow, I believe you can take advantage of the cross-node computation. While you were using the interactive session to run matlab, it will only landed on the 'main compute node' as you mentioned and cannot use resources from other nodes. Can you give it another try and see if you can make it? Best, name  Hi name, Thanks for the clarification. After setting the ""account"" option correctly, the job ran without crashing. However, it went out of control and kept submitting multiple jobs on the queue. To be clear, I first submitted a slurm job (--nodes=3, --ntasks-per-node=24; job id:id) to run my matlab script. It was fine until it started a parallel pool using the cluster profile, where it created another slurm job (3 nodes; job id:id; name: job3). Another weird thing is that the slurm output from the matlab script stated that a parallel pool of 12 workers was created, even though the cluster profile set NumWorkers as 24. And when the matlab script reached the start of the parfor loop, it created numerous 3 node slurm jobs (job id:id to 20237010_121; name: job4). I tried cancelling the main slurm job id:id. This terminated the main slurm job (id:id), and the job that was created at the parpool step (id:id). However, the other jobs associated with the parfor step (id:id to 20237010_121) kept appearing even after I cancelled them. For example, jobs 20237010_21 to 20237010_25 were created and running at the same time. I submitted an scancel command to terminate these jobs. After these jobs were terminated, 20237010_26 to 20237010_31 appeared on the queue. This went on for quite a while until it I entered ""scancel 20237010_*"" to terminate all the jobs at once. If you want, you can see the relevant files at this working directory: /scratch/name/jngoh/sweptfinsbli/arora2019b_meshv2b_runv3d/wall_plate/spectra/calc The Matlab script is ""matlab_surface_wall_plate_04_spectra_calc_parallel_2a.m"". The parpool command is found on line 38; the parfor command is at line 276. The cluster profile used is ""matlabclusterprofile_brown3.mlsettings"". The slurm job submission script is ""run_matlab_surface_wall_plate_04_spectra_calc_2a.m"". The slurm output for the main job is ""slurm-20237008.out"". I am not sure what I am doing wrong here. How many jobs should I expect Matlab to submit with the ""parpool"" and ""parfor"" commands? Thanks Regards, name  Hi name, Thank you for the updates. Yes matlab would submit several jobs during its parfor run. Those jobs with id 20237010_xx should be regarded as job array (sub-jobs submitted by a main job). So you may not be able to cancel one of them and stop the entire job array. I am not 100% sure about the mechanisms inside of matlab parallel job submitting so may need more time to explore. As we have moved from FootPrints to Team Dynamix as the new ticket system, I will close this ticket. But let's keep this conversation offline and I will get back to you when I have updates.

13724,1933698,Bell Cluster PNW,2023-06-29,2023-08-04,"Good afternoon, My name is name Bartholomew and I'm apart of Information Services at PNW. We have several faculty and staff members that use the Bell Cluster for research. The main programs these members use are Star-CCM+ and Ansys. Both of these programs license from our license server hosted at PNW (license01). We have a new license server that will be replacing license01; so our team is working with Purdue Security to get the firewalls in place. I have 2 requests for this. 1. Can you let me know the address(es) of the Bell Cluster? 2. Would there be anything need done on your end to ensure that our new license server can communicate with the bell cluster? 3. Can we get accounts setup so members of our team can test functionality on the Bell Cluster? Thank you, and please let me know if you have any questions. name Bartholomew | Central Desktop Administration Engineer Information Services Purdue University Northwest <mailto: [image002] Hi name, Thank you for contacting us! For you three questions: 1. I have assigned this ticket to our system admins to ask for the IP address range for bell nodes. 2. We don't host starccm license or ansys. There is no firewall blocking outgoing connection from bell. You will only need to allow bell's IP range on your firewall. 3. You can ask the group manager of those groups who have account on bell to add you into their group as a member or group manager, so that you can do some test works on bell.

Ive been trying to use hyper-shell to submit some jobs in parallel but have been unable to. One of my lab-mates (name nagle3) has been trying to help me with this and with creating my own environment. I am unable to do either of these things but with the same files and same commands he is able to get everything working. Is there something different about my access than his? When I first got access to the cluster I was an undergrad (and am now a grad student) Im not sure if this is even something that exists, but is there a limited access type for undergrads that I might still be on? Any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks, name Hi name, We don't have any limitation to undergraduate students. It might something related to your account setup. Can you please share the steps you used to create your environment? Also, the error messages you received? Best, name  Hello, So the main issue for me is the inability to use hypershell. Ive attached the slurm file Im submitting (which does work on someone elses account) and also the slurm.out file with the error.

These commands work for my labmate. I should also mention that my quota has been met in my home directory but when I try to delete anything it says it wont let me.

I have access to a node in name and I wanted to use the server to run MATLAB. Since I require to use an app in MATLAB to get my results, I would prefer to be able to use MATLAB interactively (with GUI) instead of having to submit a job. I tried using the remote desktop option, however, I found that the MATLAB version that opens when using the remote desktop is an older version (R2019a). I would require to use a new version of MATLAB because the older versions do not have the functionalities that I require. Is there a way to use a newer version when connecting by remote desktop? I also tried using the Gateway, but every time I try to open an interactive window, I get an error (screenshot attached below). Could you please guide me regarding how I could use a newer version of MATLAB interactively on the server, if at all that is possible? Thank you in advance! Regards, name Nayak [cid:id-6fa8-4276-ba4c-2735e0206a74] Hi name, Thank you for contacting us. I see you have requested access to 'sdyke' queue on name and it has not been approved by the managers (i.e. you don't have access to name yet). That is the reason for that error message when using Gateway. Please ask your PI or the group manager to accept the request and I will show you more steps to use Matlab GUI later after you have access. Best regards, name Senior Computational Scientist Purdue Information Technology  Hello name, Thank you so much for your reply. I didn't know that I didn't have access to name yet. Thank you for letting me know. I will ask my PI to approve that. However, I am name sure I have been granted access to a node in Gilbreth, but I see the same error when I try opening MATLAB interactively on that too (attached below). Thank you! [cid:id-c14f-4464-a630-1fbc77f349b4]  Hi, Yes you were added to Gilbreth in June but into the wrong queue. You were added to 'sdyke-i' queue which is inactive at the moment and has been replaced with 'sdyke-k' queue (there was a period that both 'sdyke-i' and 'sdyke-k' queues are valid as a transition but we have noticed groups to use the new k node queues). So you cannot access to Gilbreth gateway because of the same reason. Again, please contact your PI to add you into the 'sdyke-k' queue in order to grant you access to Gilbreth. Best, name  Hello, I have access to sdyke-k queue now. I am still getting the same error when I try to open anything interactive though. Does it take a little time to get working after I get approval? Thank you! Regards, name  It is working now!

First of all, depot space is only accessible to Purdue users (i.e. they must have a valid Purdue account) so this non-Purdue user cannot access to depot directly from outside. However, you can file the R4P (Request for Privilege) to grant a Purdue account for collaborators outside. Documentation on the process can be found here: https://www.purdue.edu/hr/buspur/supportingDocs/r4pRequestorInstructions.pdf Once the process is done and name got a Purdue account, you may add name's Purdue account to your group (the unix group 'li4578-data' which controls access to your depot folder './li4578/data'). Then you will be able to share data in that folder. Let me know if you have further questions. Best regards, name Senior Computational Scientist Purdue Information Technology  Thanks. I have filled it, and it says: Successfully created new request with id 125930 in org unit 00000357 and the approvers have been notified  Hi, Thank you for the updates. Feel free to let me know when the account is ready so we can move on to add it to your depot space. Best, name  Hi name and name, I was out of town on a two-weeks vacation, so chiming in late and mostly for completeness sake. The way name suggested is perfectly valid (do an R4P for the external collaborator, this generates a valid Purdue career account for them, then add this account to your group in our system to grant them access to your Depot space so they could upload necessary data). This is the usual route we recommend for long-term collaborations (and the only one possible if cluster access is needed along with just data). Looks like you are well underway on this path, so everything is getting close to successful finish. For completeness sake, I wanted to mention that there is also an alternative that does not involve R4P and/or full-scale access to your Depot space, and could be occasionally very handy for one-offs or short-term data transfers. It would involve Globus (very similar to what we did when transferring Vermont data). In this scenario, name could create a Globus share anchored in a specific subfolder of your Depot space, and grant name write access to this share (and only this share!) in Globus. This is very handy when you need a data drop to or from people who are not at Purdue and do not have accounts on our storage systems (this is the beauty of Globus sharing). I love Globus for large scale data transfers and sharing, so just wanted to proselytize a little :) Thanks, name Rosen Center for Advanced Computing (RCAC)  Hi, Since we haven't heard feedback from you for some time, issues seem to have been solved.

Thank you, Jerry  Hi Jerry and name, Terribly sorry, this is my fault for being swamped and not responding earlier! Fortress accounts come as an add-on with any other RCAC resource. The easiest way to achieve this would be to set up a Data Depot space for the PURR team, and that would automatically provision a shared group space on Fortress. I know PURR used to have a Depot space, but eventually decided to delete it due to lack of need. Would you be ok with recreating it (on a small free 100GB scale), essentially as a door opener? Thanks, name Rosen Center for Advanced Computing (RCAC)  Hi name, Thank you for your email and completely understand about the timing. Recreating the space sounds great. Jerry and I spoke this morning and hell be working to get this all set with you all. What information do you all need for doing this? Also, Jerry and I wanted to be sure and ask about how to access the space once it is recreated. Thanks for your help with this! - name, PhD (she/they) Research Data Systems Manager Purdue University Research Repository (PURR)<https://purr.purdue.edu/> Purdue University Libraries <mailto: (  Hi name and Jerry, Apologies again for a delay. Turns out, while we did delete the old /depot/purr, the PURR group itself (as a unit in our system) was not removed. So the space on Fortress exists, and I just need to add you into this group. My bad, I should have remembered that that earlier... when PURR Depot was deleted, all we did was deleting _a resource_ that the PURR group owned, not the _group itself_. So last night I: * Added name in a manager role to PURR group in our system * Added Jerry in a group member role * Removed old managers (pmeunier and scaldron) This morning noticed a small back-end glitch in the addition process (which affected Jerry a lot and name a little). I think I fixed it just now and it should propagate overnight, I am keeping an eye. If you login to https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/account/myinfo you should see yourselves as being members of ""PURR Hub Group"". From there, under ""Groups"", name would also be able to manage the group (add/remove people, etc). Direct access to /group/purr on Fortress is controlled by membership in 'purr-data' Unix group - so make sure to tick that box for anyone that needs it (but see the Globus discussion below, perhaps this may not be necessary) ----------------------------------------- Now, how to put things into Fortress? The three supported methods are SFTP, HSI and HTAR, and Globus (https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/fortress/storage). SFTP can be command-line or GUI based. HSI and HTAR are command-line tools (HSI looks similar to old-school FTP, HTAR mimics regular tar). HSI and HTAR are installed on all RCAC systems, and we have them packages for download if people want to install on their computers (Linux only). And of course Globus is Globus. All in all, I think we should setup a Globus-based archival workflow. Universal, both GUI and scriptable, reliable, and so on. Now, there are two ways of doing this: 1. Jerry (and any other PURR staff that will be doing transfers) can go to the Fortress primary endpoint (the main ""Purdue Fortress HPSS Archive"" collection), navigate to /group/purr and start transferring. This is a direct route, all files are written to Fortress with the writer's individual credentials (but this is fine as long as they are members of the 'purr-data' Unix group) 2. Someone (probably name) logs in to the primary Fortress endpoint and makes a *Globus share* (a.k.a. Guest Collection) anchored at /group/purr. Then you make a few people co-managers of that share in case you get hit by a bus, and then you have a flexibility of doling out read or write permissions on the share (or specific subfolders inside the share) to whoever needs to have access to it. This is conceptually very similar to what we did on the PURR side for uploads. The advantages of the second approach are multiple: - Familiar, and done in many other place. Essentially, this is how Globus recommends doing it. - Flexible access controls on the share * People don't need to be added to the 'purr-data' Unix group, all permissions are regulated in Globus * 'purr-data' is essentially all or nothing. Globus permissions can be as granular or general as you need them. - No matter who does the transfer, all files are written with credentials of the person who created the share. This helps against occasional obscure ""permissions denied"" errors on the filesystem level. Not critical (and if such errors creep in, we can always easily fix them), but one less support ticket. What do you think?  Hi name, Thank you for creating the Globus group for us. I tried accessing both the Fortress primary endpoint and the PURR directory, but Im not able to. Please see attached.

13756,1936273,Working with Large Files on Gilbreth for an Extended Period of Time,2023-07-03,2023-07-17,"Hello, I'm currently a graduate student in Dr. name' lab in structural name. We're interested in computing on the clusters, and I already have access to Gilbreth through the pi4d-h group. Our lab focuses on cryo-electron tomography and all the computing that comes with it, and the files we work with are very large. In general, one fully reconstructed bin1 tomogram is 100+ gb and a full tomography project can be terabytes of data. If I'm looking at my quota correctly, it says I have 25gb in my home directory and 200tb in my scratch directory. The 200tb will work for us, since we plan on working on our tomograms in batches and probably never a full project at once. How often does scratch get emptied? A project can take months to complete, so we're worried about the scratch getting cleared out before we can finish what we're working on. Is there a way we can stop the scratch directory from clearing out or another more long-term solution or place to store our data on Gilbreth? Thank you for your help, please let me know if you have any questions! Best, name Hi name, Thank you for contacting us. Files are purged from scratch directories not accessed or had content modified in 60 days. The owner of these files will receive a notice one week before removal via email. You may consider purchasing into data depot space (it's $70/per TB/per year) so you can have long-term data access for the entire group. Another good option is Fortress which is designed for long-term data storage. You will have access to unlimited Fortress space for free once you have cluster access. And we provide 'hsi' and 'htar' commands which are both easy-to-use interfaces into the archive and can be used to copy files into the archive interactively or even automatically at the end of your regular job submission scripts. Here is an introduction of Fortress fyi: https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/fortress?all=true. The disadvantage of Fortress is that it's much slower to extract data out of it as it will reply on actual physical arms to read out data from tapes. Let me know if you have further questions.

13758,1936345,help with matlab parallel job on Bell,2023-07-03,2023-07-19,"Hello, I am trying to run a job with matlab parallel on Bell. Ideally I need about 20 cores to run the task. Currently, I have two interactive sessions in the queue. I have two questions about this. A Bell-related question: One of the sessions requested has 12 cores and 2 hours of time, but I have been waiting the entire day for that. In the past, the waiting time was much lower, so I am not sure if I am making a mistake, or if there is a more efficient way to ask for these resources. A Matlab-related question: I noticed that sometimes one core goes out of memory. Do you know how I can find out (and later set on Bell) the memory needed for each core? Thank you, name Hi name, Thank you for contacting us. For your questions: 1) It's simply because that there are not enough CPU resources available from your queue 'krannert'. If you can navigate to 'Cluster -> Bell Shell Access' and type 'slist' in the pop-out terminal, you will see the current usage for the queues. e.g. As I am seeing right now: ############### Current Number of Cores Node Account Total Queue Run Free Max Walltime Type ============== ================================= ============== ====== debug 256 249 0 256 00:30:00 A gpu 512 0 128 384 G highmem 1024 1083 865 159 1-00:00:00 B krannert 512 233 512 0 14-00:00:00 A multigpu 48 0 0 48 G standby 48896 8657 1762 14805 04:00:00 A ############### 2) By default you will get ~2GB/per core for your session job. e.g. If you get 12 cores, you will get ~24 GB memory. This can also be found in the terminal mentioned above by typing 'jobinfo jobid', where jobid is the number you got after the MATLAB in the title of 'my interactive sessions' page. I don't think you can modify this memory per core from Bell gateway. You can try 'highmem' queue which is configured as ~8GB/per core if you need more memory per core. Let me know if you have further questions. Best regards, name Senior Computational Scientist Purdue Information Technology  Hello, After running in parallel on Matlab for a few hours (I was running a job with 64 nodes, and used just 20 in parallel, to avoid crash), I got an error message, and apparently I can no longer run in parallel.

FR  Hi, There might be some glitches for Bell scratch yesterday morning but now it should be gone. If your workflow was related to Bell scratch space and you saw an error message 'no space left on device', it should be related. But it should not be your case (when you saw the error 'disk quota exceeded'). This issue is related to the fact that your $HOME folder is full. The solution would be clean up some spaces in your home directory by either deleting or moving out files from the home directory. You can fulfill this task through actions via gateway.bell -> Files -> Home Directory or through ssh to bell. Again, you can still use the above terminal on Bell and type 'myquota' to check your current quota (it shows 100% full for you $HOME now).

I have it running on Bell with intel compilers (they performed far better than GCC). But I saw on the Negishi web page that the GCC compilers are recommended. Perhaps a dumb question but does this apply for CESM given intel did better than GCC on Bell? Is there any other advice for working on Negishi vs Bell? I also see a module or two that isn't compiled for the intel compilers and that I would need (e.g. intel-mkl), so maybe GCC is the way to go... Thanks. Nick. Hi Nick, Thank you for contacting us. Negishi has similar hardware structures with Bell (e.g. both are equipped with AMD CPUs) but the main difference is the OS while Negishi is Rocky 8 and Bell is CentOS 7. I cannot really give you specific advice on CESM before some experiments with different compilers. But we saw some applications not performing as expected with intel compiler on Negishi fyi. So I would encourage you to try both ways and see how the performance differentiate with different compilers. Hope it helps.

I appreciate you probably get a lot of app requests, but unless there's a workaround for this issue that doesn't involve ""annobin"" then this would prevent a lot of climate science being done on the cluster (e.g. I assume a lot of people run CESM on bell/name, these people wouldn't be able to do their work on Negishi).

It looks like you are using Perl package, XML::LibXML, which is probably not comparable with new version of GCC compiler. Negishi has gcc/12.2.0, while both Bell and name has lower version of gcc. Our scientist even tried to use gcc/8.5.0 for XML::LibXML on Negishi and did not get any luck of it. So we guess the problem is not about annobin, it's about Perl with gcc. You might want to continue to trouble-shoot the process and find out what hinders the installation. The other thing I'd like to mention is our old ticket system, which is the current one we are using right now, is going to retire in about 10 days. New system has been online today. It is better to resolve the tickets at old system before it becomes inactive. If you need further help or want more discussion, we can create a new ticket on your behalf in our new system.

13767,1936652,Inquiry Regarding Purdue BOX.COM and Data Storage Options,2023-07-05,2023-07-19,"Hello, I have some questions regarding the use of Purdue BOX.COM and its storage capabilities. Currently, I have been utilizing my personal Purdue BOX.COM cloud storage to collect sensor and machine data from collaborative projects with local Indiana manufacturing companies. The data mainly consists of sound/noise files in WAV format and CSV files from IoT sensors like power meters and accelerometers. Consequently, the daily data size is quite substantial. Recently, I encountered an issue where data collection was halted due to the limited storage capacity of my BOX.COM account. I had believed that the storage was unlimited, but upon reviewing the Purdue BOX.COM policy, I discovered it is actually limited to 1 TB. Consequently, I now need to migrate all previous data and, more importantly, find an alternative method for data collection. Therefore, I am considering purchasing the BOX.COM Research Lab Folder from Purdue (https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/storage/boxfolder). I have a couple of questions regarding this option.

First of all, I would mention that you were sending three tickets to us, with three different ticket number, 1937286, 1937311, and 1937323 (this one). I think they are the same. I guess this is a systematically mistake, sometimes we receive multiple tickets. To keep our communication in one place, I would close the other two and leave current one (1937323) open. It seems the error is related to GCC compiler. Can you share more about your workflow, like what modules you loaded, what libraries you installed before you configure rheoTool? Cheers, --- name, PhD Sr. Computational Scientist RCAC Research Computing Purdue University  I loaded gcc, openmpi, openfoam, hypre, openblas, and netlib-lapack. Other dependencies were installed downloadEigen and installPetsc. downloadEigen works fine. I commented out the sudo commands in installPetsc and finished the configuration manually according to the attached configure command. Let me know if you have any other questions, thanks! Mitch  Hi name, Thanks for sharing these information. I saw you registered one of our coffee hour consultation tomorrow. I think we can talk about this at 3pm over Teams meeting. Cheers, name  Hi name, As we talked over coffee hour, I would mark this ticket resolved for now. Also because this ticket system is going to be inactive in a few days. The new one has launched today.

I am on Dr. name's group but I cannot access her Depot directory even though on her end it says I am given permissions 2. I am using an ubuntu/linux and the terminal keeps freezing and logging me out of sessions while I am working after 5 mins of being on there. Originally, I was using a windows system and an ssh client and this was happening, but I rebooted my pc into linux to prevent this exact thing from happening. But now that it is still happening I am very frustrated because I never would be using Linux if this was going to still be an issue. It seems to be a bug on my account and not others. Please help me :') I am sad. Thanks, name Hi name, It sounds like a network issues: your network might be unstable, causing your SSH sessions to drop. A good solution (also what I am using now) is to download a Thinlinc client: https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/gilbreth/accounts/login/thinlinc ThinLinc is that it allows you to start a remote desktop session and then disconnect from it without ending the session. When you close your ThinLinc client window, the session continues to run on the server. This allows you to reopen the ThinLinc client and reconnect to the same session later, with all your applications still open and running exactly as you left them. Best, name  Hi name, I used an ethernet last night (: I do not think it is an internet issues. Also do you have a potential resolution for the Depot Directory issue? Sorry for the inconvenience and thank you so much. name  Hi name, Please try the Thinlinc client and see if it helps.

Thank you. name  [Duplicate message snipped]  Ticket forwards from FP.  Forward FP ticket to TDX.  Hello, I am trying to use a CFD package that was provided to me, CONVERGE CFD. I've installed the software in my home directory but am struggling to get it to launch. I've contacted their support and I have a few questions regarding the Negishi/ThinLinc environment. * CONVERGE uses the Qt library, does Negishi/ThinLinc support VirtualGL? They mentioned that this may be required if using the software remotely. * The executable does not use the environment version of Qt (i.e. module load qt) but rather a version of Qt that was shipped with the software. Would this create any problems? I don't load Qt in hopes that there is no conflict. Thanks, name Graduate Research Assistant Maurice J. Zucrow Labs <mailto: Current Assignees: ITAP_RC_SUPPORT, name  Hi name, Thank you for contacting us. Are you trying to launch the GUI for Converge CFD? If so, can yo show me the specific steps you used to launch your Converge CFD and the error message when it failed to start? Sometimes QT might not be the root cause for 'qt errors' as we have resolved similar issues for other applications. So if possible, can you run 'export QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1' before you start the GUI and see what is the error message after you launch the app? Best regards, name Senior Computational Scientist Purdue Information Technology  name, Yes, I am trying to run the GUI. I installed the software in my home directory and I didnt get any errors so I believe everything was installed correctly. I run a shell script that was provided to me (attached to the email.) I open a terminal in the cwd with the script and invoke by ./CONVERGE_Studio. I get the following error. I have tried loading qt, mesa, and xcb-util before running the script but the error is the same. I added the Qt debug to the script and put the output in the attachment. :[bin<mailto::[bin>] $ ./CONVERGE_Studio [RELEASE] : Error : libXp.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory [RELEASE] : vDynamicLoader -- Could not open library : VisREBase qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin ""xcb"" in ""/home/mhoeper/CONVERGE/v3.1/bin/plugins"" even though it was found.

I think what you are seeing now is a fine semantic difference between 'id' and 'id jones105' - a plain 'id' show your group affiliations *in this running shell* (as it was started, i.e. before the addition). Whereas an 'id jones105' would show group membership *of the user* (as the cluster knows them). Normally these two views are identical... but not during membership changes. And 'id jones105' does shows the cae2 group as expected. TL;DR: Just open a new terminal window and that shell process will get blessed with updated memberships.

I just left you a voicemail as well. Below is the email I sent to IT earlier this week. I've been trying to get clarification on this issue for a few weeks now and really need to get this resolved so that I can submit the data request. I've been working with name (Information Systems Security Manager) but he directed me to work with CLA IT. If I'm granted access to the data, he will sign the data use agreement. ---- I am writing to ask for assistance with security requirements for restricted use data from the National Center for Health Statistics that I am applying to access and analyze for a recently submitted grant proposal. I am writing to find out if the storage at Purdue meets the requirements outlined below, or if I need to have an air-gapped computer installed in my office. For example, is there a secure server where I can store my data? Can I use my regular office computer to analyze the data based on the requirements below? This is my first time accessing this kind of data and I don't fully understand where I would need to store the data so that it fits the security requirements. Thank you in advance for your help! The requirements for data storage and access are: ""DVS restricted data may not be accessed outside of the U.S.A. and should be stored on, and accessed from, the secure computer system of the affiliated organization or institution. If a secure computer system is not available, the data may be stored on a password-protected, encrypted computer protected by anti-malware and anti-virus software. Storage and access of data files using a cloud-based system is not permitted."" Follow up information for the data storage requirements is online: ""The data files should be stored on, and accessed from, the secure computer system of the researchers affiliated organization or institution. This means that files will be housed on a server that is behind a firewall, has data encryption, permits file access only to the approved researchers, and has encrypted network communications; the researcher would then access the files from a password-protected institutional desktop or laptop. If a secure computer system is not available, files should be stored on an encrypted, password-protected, stand-alone computer or laptop protected by anti-virus and anti-malware software. The computer or laptop should be air-gapped for additional security as feasible. Permission from NCHS is required to store data files on a personal computer or laptop."" https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/nvss-restricted-data.htm<https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fnchs%2Fnvss%2Fnvss-restricted-data.htm&data=05%7C01%7Crcac-help%40purdue.edu%7Cab95dbc70502412330f908db7f160ee4%7C4130bd397c53419cb1e58758d6d63f21%7C0%7C0%7C638243504932804263%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=krXBk8SM98rEvUBOLPGo5ROk4udatsQaBu%2FfUJMfSh4%3D&reserved=0> There is also a follow up question that must be answered on the application: ""Please describe your institutions data protection procedures, and if possible, state who will be responsible for the security of the DVS restricted data.""

We detected a rapid sweep of file access time updates consistent with blanket touching of all or part of your scratch directory in an attempt to circumvent purging. This is a clear and obvious violation of our acceptable use policy. The scratch filesystems are for limited-duration, high-performance storage of data for running jobs or workflows and are explicitly not intended to be used as a long-term storage. Doing so, or engaging in measures to circumvent purging, adversely affects all users of the system and our ability to provide such liberal quotas. Please review the scratch purge<https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/policies/scratchpurge> and resource usage<https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/policies/resourceuse> policies. Immediately cease this behavior and clear any unused data where possible. If necessary, consult our user guides and training material on archiving data and job outputs to the tape archive (Fortress).

If so, you can delete the memory command and the slrum job scheduler will only give you 1 core. Best, name  Hi: Thanks. That partly explains it.

Im fortunately part of two different Anvil projects (tra220018 and cis220051) thus I have to areas I can check simultaneously. For example, there will be times where on login00, creates in /anvil/projects/tra220018 will take 1 second, but they will be instant in /anvil/projects/tdm or vice versa. During this same time, creates on login01 will be fine on both, but login02 could be slow in /anvil/projects/tdm and fast in /anvil/projects/tra220018. My simple loop to test is one of these (note I use the very fast > to create files rather than using the Trojaned and slower /usr/local/bin/touch) sanvil ""cd /anvil/projects/tdm/corporate/test && (rm -f {1..10}; time (for i in {1..10}; do echo $i > $i; done))"" sanvil ""cd /anvil/projects/x-tra220018/2023/dgc && (rm -f {1..10}; time (for i in {1..10}; do echo $i > $i; done))"" After things were resolved after the major Anvil downtime a couple of weeks ago, both of the above returned immediately with no slow creates. Immediately after the login01 reboot a few days ago I noticed the file creates started taking a long time again. I cant say if it was causal, but it was certainly correlated. 6: There are currently hundreds of jobs in device wait across the various front-ends.

Many of us have accumulated quite a few personal Quick Customer Notes (e.g. I have good couple dozens, and they are tremendously helpful). Is there a way to do a mass download of my existing quick notes (like a zip archive with one text file per note, or similar)? Anything that is more efficient than me copy-pasting one by one? Thanks, name Rosen Center for Advanced Computing (RCAC) Hi name, Unfortunately, TeamDynamix does not have the ability for individual technicians to have their own custom signatures. There are a few that are created globally that are very generic (called ""templates"" if you are updating a ticket) and we are discussing creating a few more for the Service Desks, but not oodles for anyone. If your groups or unit have a handful of templates that can be shared amongst them, we can configure a catagory and create them in the PurdueIT Tickets app in TDX. Not the answer you were looking for, I'm sure. We've found a few bummers, but we'll see if we can accommodate you need as best we can. name Courtney  Where does this go?

This is because your home directory is full so ThinLinc (Remote Desktop) cannot create or modify files in $HOME which is essential during its startup. The solution would be clean up some spaces in your home directory by either deleting or moving out files from the home directory. You can fulfill this task through actions via gateway.name -> Files -> Home Directory or through ssh to name. Please give it a try and let me know if it works.

Thank you, name Graduate Student Purdue University Department of Horticulture & Landscape Architecture Horticulture Building, 625 Agriculture Mall Drive West Lafayette, IN 47907-2010  Hi name, For that auto logout issue, I suspect it's related to your network. Can you try a different network (with/without Purdue VPN) and see if it helps? If you want to get access to your professor's depot space, talk with your professor and ask him to add you into the group 'hirst-data' (for subfolder ./data) and 'hirst-apps' (for subfolder ./apps). We can also help if permission is granted by Prof. Hirst. As we have moved from FootPrints to Team Dynamix as the new ticket system, I will close this ticket.
