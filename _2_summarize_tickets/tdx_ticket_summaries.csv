7970,Issue with Gilbreth,Student Lydia is unable to generate expected output from a job run on Gilbreth HPC and desires guidance on potential issues and resolution.,"The issue seems to be related to the job termination due to reaching wall time limit, as indicated by errors in the 'slurm-jobid.out' files. To address this, it is suggested to increase the wall time for the jobs and try again. Additionally, if Lydia wants to print all training results into a single file rather than the slurm output file, she can use a command like `python xxxx > training.out` during job submission. This will write all outputs from that python run into the 'training.out' file. For debugging purposes before submitting a batch job, it is recommended to request an interactive job using 'sinteractive' and run the python workflow there. This will provide an interactive session to run the code and see the results directly. Here is an example of how to submit an interactive job:

```
sinteractive -A guo675-h --nodes=1 --gpus-per-node=1 --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=16 --time=0-3:00:00 --job-name disprior_test
```

After getting resources, Lydia can run the commands after '#SBATH' lines. For instance, `module load anaconda` followed by `module load cuda`. This should help with debugging and prevent the job termination due to time limits in the future."
8093,Unable to Access ThinLinc,User cannot login to ThinLinc on Bell cluster due to incorrect password entry method.,"To login Remote Desktop for Bell, the user needs to use the new Purdue Login method. Instead of entering just a password, they should type their password followed by `',push'`. For example, if the password is '123456789', they would type '123456789,push'. This should either trigger the Duo app push request or the four-digit DUO push code followed by ',push'."

12810,"""nanox-K"" queue on the Gilbreth cluster","The user, Assistant Professor Elmore, needs to monitor GPU usage and identify the compute node address of a specific job in the ""nanox-K"" queue on the Gilbreth cluster, without affecting the existing resource allocation for GPU jobs.","- To get a Slurm job on a particular host (for monitoring), use the command `sinteractive -A nanox-K -w <nodename> ...--gpus-per-node=1`. However, this requires an empty GPU on that node. - Monitoring an existing job can only be done by the user who owns the job. The user can find the host the job is running on using the command `jobinfo x`, where 'x' is the job ID of the running job. After that, the user can directly SSH to that host to run the monitoring tool of interest. - To check which user is currently using the queue, use the command `squeue -A nanox-K`. - For real-time usage monitoring of a job, utilize the monitor utility as explained by the colleague: <https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/index.php/knowledge/gilbreth/run/examples/slurm/monitor>. For tracking GPU usage trends over time, check out XDmod at <http://xdmod.rcac.purdue.edu/>. Note that the user may need to set up a personalized xdmod page for detailed information."

49071,Gilbreth Nodes Purchase Information,"The user is inquiring about the core count for a single purchase of Gilbreth nodes, specifically the A30 and A100 GPUs, and if there are other purchasing options available. They also ask whether it's possible to customize the purchase nodes into different accounts with varying wall-time limits. Lastly, they seek clarification on their understanding about the concurrent jobs and retirement time of these nodes for a 5-year package.","The user can find detailed specifications of Gilbreth nodes at this link: RCAC - Compute: Gilbreth The number of cores per node depends on the specific type of node purchased, and it is possible to calculate the proportional share according to the GPU count per node and cores/memory per node. Currently, the listed options are what is being offered. If the user is looking for monthly subscription options, those can be accommodated as well, but may cost more for long-term use. The maximum walltime limit for a lab/group's queue (Slurm account) is 14 days, but users may request less than 14 days for their jobs. If the user purchases access to 1 A100-80GB GPU, they can submit jobs to their lab/group queue requesting various walltimes, e.g. 5 hours or 2 days. However, it is important to note that Gilbreth is configured for GPU jobs only and each job must request at least 1 GPU. If the user purchases access to 1 A100-80GB GPU, they will get a queue in the K partition (sub-cluster), allowing them to run 1 job on 1 GPU at a time in their lab/group queue. For each of their jobs, they can request up to 32 cores (proportional to the core/GPU ratio). In the standby queue, multiple concurrent jobs and requests for multiple GPUs with less walltimes (up to 4 hours) are allowed. The K partition is planned to be retired in 2028, so there will still be 5 years until then. If the user is interested in getting a free two-week trial access for their group to familiarize themselves with the job submission system and test if their workflow works on Gilbreth, they may contact the support team to arrange that."
49115,cannot find -luuid,"Installation of R package (""bigtabulate"") on Negishi cluster is failing due to missing uuid library.","Load the `util-linux-uuid` module onto Negishi, wait for 4 hours for the update to be populated to all nodes, then try installing the ""bigtabulate"" R package again. The command to load the module is:

319656,Requesting Access to 'training' Queue on Gilbreth,User request for access to the 'training' queue on the Gilbreth RCAC compute cluster for DL model training due to high computational requirements.,"The user is required to demonstrate that their job can be scaled across multiple GPUs and requires more than 4 hours of runtime to access the 'training' queue. To do this, they should scale their code to use multiple GPUs, submit the job for four hours on the standby queue, share the jobID, and provide evidence that their code is fully utilizing the specified number of GPUs and couldn't be completed within four hours. If the code can meet these requirements, access will be granted. The user should refer to the policy available at https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/gilbreth/run/slurm/queues for more details about the 'training' queue on Gilbreth."
482060,When will new purchased GPU nodes be available?,User needs access to newly added A100 GPUs and wants to know how to check GPU usage by other users in the system.,"To check details for running jobs, including GPU usage, use the following command: `sacct -aX --state=R --format=jobid,user,jobname,account,State,time%12,elapsed%12,ReqTRES%50 | grep ""cgb\|Job""`.

It will help the user to identify the GPU usage by other users in the system."
49977,Gilbreth Pytorch 2.0.1/Cuda 11.7 can not find GPU,The user created a conda environment for Pytorch but is unable to find the GPU device when starting Python. The issue persists even though R Torch can detect the GPU.,"To resolve this issue, the user should install Pytorch using the following command:
```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```
After installation, they can check if the GPU is detected by running the following Python script:
```python
import torch
print(f'Torch: {torch._version_}CUDA: {torch.version.cuda}CUDA devices: {torch.cuda.device_count()}CUDA device name: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}')
```
The expected output should be `Torch: 2.0.1 CUDA: 11.7`. If you encounter issues related to space in your /home, you can relocate the conda installation cache by moving it to another directory and creating a softlink, as shown below:
```bash
mv ~/.conda /depot/mylab/users/me/conda
ln -sf /depot/mylab/users/me/conda ~/.conda
```
This will move the existing environment cache and create a softlink to $HOME/.conda. Be careful when using Scratch folder, as it will be purged regularly. To change the location of a new environment during creation, use the `-p /path_to_your_env/env_name` option to specify a custom path. For more information about managing environments with modules and conda-env-mod usage, check out this guide: https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/gilbreth/run/examples/apps/python/packages"
50440,Bell cluster issue,User is unable to access depot space 'hamakerb' on Bell cluster due to permission denied error.,"The reason for the permission denied error was that the user had not been added to the necessary groups ('hamakerb', 'hamakerb-data', and 'hamakerb-apps') controlling access to the depot space. Dr. Lavanya Reddivari was asked to add the user into these groups accordingly to grant them access. The user should have access to the depot space within a few hours after being added."
50713,Question: Submitted task in queue with Available GPUs,Job submission with 2 GPUs and 16 cores each on `ziran-k` account is experiencing delays in starting.,"The issue appears to be related to the SLURM scheduler needing time to arrange available resources for job submissions, especially when the resource requirements are high. It's not uncommon for jobs with fewer resource requirements to get started sooner if there are enough resources available. If a job on owner queue starts within 4 hours, it should not be considered abnormal."
450657,Question about A100 GPU,"A student is unable to access the A100 GPU due to a pending job request with the reason ""Resources"".","The issue was resolved when the job request was processed. The delay in processing the job request was due to the requested resources (1 GPU and 16 cores) not being immediately available in the gilbreth-k partition, which was busy. This waiting period is within expectation as the job only waited 10 minutes and 25 seconds to get started. Users can check the status of their jobs using the command `jobinfo [job_id]`. For example, `jobinfo 7187212` would provide information about job 7187212. In this case, the output would show that the job is running with state ""RUNNING"". If users have further questions or concerns, they can reply to this ticket to re-open it."
482506,Inquiry on Supercomputing Resources for ABAQUS Jobs,"User seeks advice on suitable computational resources for ABAQUS simulations, with a focus on Negishi as a potential option and recommendations for alternative solutions.","After scheduling a meeting between the user and support staff member to discuss options in detail, it was noted that the user needs to update their ABAQUS license before proceeding with the 2-week Negishi trial."

51104,Clarification on GPU Availability for Canli-k Lab Account,Clarification required on GPU availability for the Canli-k lab account and whether each lab member can individually access a GPU or if only one GPU is available at a time for the entire lab.,"The canli-k queue has access to 1 GPU, which means in this queue all jobs together can use up to 1 GPU at a time. On Gilbreth, each of your jobs must request at least 1 GPU and up to the proportional count of cores (32 cores in your case). Therefore, jobs submitted to the canli-k queue by your lab members will be scheduled one by one (unless your group purchases access to more GPUs). You will not be able to submit jobs that request cores only but no GPUs. If you have any further questions, please let the support team know."
51251,Java installation,Unable to submit job for Stanford NLP package due to missing Java dependency.,"To resolve the issue, follow these steps:

   - Extract the tarball by using the command ""tar -xf <name_of_the_.tar.gz_file>"". For example: ""tar -xf jdk-21_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz""
   - Add Java to your PATH environment variable or set JAVA\_HOME environment variable to the installation directory (/path/to/java/installation/bin/java). If you will use this application frequently, add a line to your ~/.bash_profile file like: export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/java/installation/bin/java. Replace ""/path/to/java/installation/bin/java"" with the real path to the */bin/java directory. - After doing these steps, your application should work."

However, the issue still persists. To properly install pymeshlab and pyqt5 in this environment, please follow these steps:

   a. First, ensure that you have both libraries (pymeshlab and pyqt5) listed in your environment's requirements file (e.g., `environment.yml` or `environment.txt`). If they are not already there, add the required packages as follows:

      ```
      name: tree-py3.9.7

        - pyqt
      ```
   b. Create a new environment using the requirements file with the following command: `conda create --name tree-py3.9.7 --file environment.yml`. c. Activate the created environment: `source activate tree` or `conda activate tree`. d. Install the required packages:
      ```
      conda install -c conda-forge pymeshlab pyqt5
      ```
   e. Now, you should be able to import the library without any issues: `python3 -c ""import pymeshlab""`. If you still encounter problems, double-check that the installed version of Qt is compatible with pymeshlab by running the following command:

      ```
      python3 -c ""from pymeshlab._init_ import *; from pymeshlab.lib import meshlab_common; print(meshlab_common.meshlabVersion())""

652613,[bera89-k] Shareable GPU nodes on Gilbreth,User request for enabling sharing of a GPU compute node among students within their group to optimize usage of the available VRAM.,"Unfortunately, the current Slurm system is not compatible with direct sharing of a single GPU among multiple users. However, one student can run a job at the request of another labmate. For high-throughput AI tasks, it would be possible to use a service account with HyperShell and have multiple users submit their ""jobs"" to HyperShell instead of Slurm directly. Additionally, meeting with RCAC staff for further discussion on this issue is recommended. For a single user, it's possible to circumvent the issue by using a pilot-job pattern where the job isn't the task itself, and employ some multiprocessing techniques to parallelize smaller tasks on a large GPU. If possible, consider using less VRAM for your jobs or explore other resources that support sharing GPUs among users. Here is a link to personalized sessions with RCAC staff: https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/coffee"

Simultaneously, the same codes run immediately on R Studio Server with 55 nodes and 20 hours.","The user may be encountering an issue where their scheduled jobs are not prioritized or are experiencing resource contention. To troubleshoot this problem:
   - Verify that the job queue is not full or overloaded. Check the HPC system's job queue status using a command like `qstat` and ensure there are enough available resources for the job to run. - Examine the user's batch script (or SLURM job script if applicable) for any errors, such as incorrect resource requests or syntax issues. Check that the requested resources (nodes, RAM, time, etc.) match the needs of the job. - Consult the HPC system documentation or reach out to your system administrator for guidance on optimizing job submission and scheduling. - If necessary, adjust job priority settings in the batch script or contact your system administrator to request higher priority for the specific job(s). - To avoid potential resource contention with other users' jobs, consider breaking down large jobs into smaller tasks that can be submitted concurrently and run sequentially. This approach may help ensure timely completion of computationally intensive analyses."

792162,Using Multiple Workers in DataLoader,"The user is facing issues with the PyTorch dataloader on a GPU cluster when running with more than 1 worker and encountering warnings about potential slowdowns or freezes. Additionally, the user is having trouble monitoring GPU usage and encountering an error using utilities monitor. There's also a runtime warning related to os.fork() and JAX.","To resolve the issue with the PyTorch dataloader on a GPU cluster, you should request more CPUs for your job (at least 4, one for each worker). Modify your submission script by adding `#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=5`. This will allocate 5 CPUs per task in your job. To use 4 workers with the pytorch dataloader, add a sample script provided below to your job submission file:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -A testpbs
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --gpus-per-node=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=5
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1
#SBATCH --mem=256GB
#SBATCH --time=04:00:00
echo ""have access to $(nproc) CPUs!"" #Will be ntasks*cpus-per-task! /path/to/python test.py
```
This should help you utilize the GPUs efficiently and avoid potential slowness or freezing due to excessive worker creation. Regarding monitoring GPU usage, since utilities monitor is not available on Gilbreth, try using `rocm-smi` while SSH'd to the compute node your job is running on:
```bash
rocm-smi
```
For addressing the os.fork() and JAX issue, consider reviewing your code or consult with a developer or HPC expert for further guidance."
292102,Dear RCAC Help,User is unable to run Python code using GPU on Bell cluster due to an aborted error (37335). User requests help in modifying the script to utilize GPU resources and asks about the maximum number of GPUs and cores available.,"To resolve this issue, please provide the Python script you are trying to run in the text of your email for further analysis. Once I have the script, I will be able to guide you on how to modify it to utilize GPU resources on the Bell cluster. For reference, you can use the `module load` command followed by the name of the necessary modules (such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) to ensure that the required libraries are installed and available for your script. Regarding the maximum number of GPUs and cores available on Bell cluster, you can typically request up to 8 GPUs or 64 CPU cores depending on the queue and available resources. For more detailed information about resource requests and allocation on Bell cluster, please refer to the following documentation: [Bell Cluster Resource Requests](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/docs/using-bell-cluster/resource-requests/)

Once you have made the necessary modifications to your script and adjusted your resource request accordingly, submit your job using the `qsub` command along with your modified Python script and other required files. For example:

```bash
qsub -I -l select=1:ncpus=64:gpus=8 my_script.py

798363,Questions about Gautschi computing cluster,"The user needs clarification about the Gautschi cluster's compute resource hours sales protocol and its comparison with Negishi and Bell clusters, specifically for the CPU partition. They also need help understanding if purchasing multiple quarter-node shares of CPU allows jobs to utilize all cores for a single job and what specific steps are needed during purchase to ensure this.","On Gautschi, you purchase a 48-core share in the CPU partition, which grants access to run jobs across the cluster, including in the highmem partition. So yes, jobs submitted to highmem are included in your access — it's essentially an added benefit of purchasing into the Gautschi CPU environment. There's no separate accounting or charge for highmem usage. When you purchase more than one quarter-node share of CPU (e.g., 96 or even 192 cores), you can run jobs across all these cores for a single job, but all cores must be purchased under the same account — Gautschi doesn't support cross-account jobs. No special setup is required during purchase; ensure all your cores are purchased under the same account name/billing entity and you'll be able to use them together for single jobs."

To specify a job to run on either the CPU or GPU partition, use the '-p' or '--partition=' options when submitting the job (e.g., ""-p ai"" or ""--partition=ai"" for the AI GPU hours, and ""-p cpu"" or ""--partition=cpu"" for the high performance CPU cores). Jobs running on the CPU cores with the ""-p cpu"" flag do not subtract hours from your AI Partition balance, and jobs running on the AI Partition with ""-p ai"" do not tie up any of your available CPU cores. This means that you can still run jobs on both partitions simultaneously. More details about the partition separation can be found at this link: https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/gautschi/run/slurm/queues"

818117,Question about Gautschi partitions,"Doctoral Candidate needs help determining which Gautschi cluster partition is best suited for their GPU-accelerated programming tasks, and wants to know how the smallgpu partition charges against their GPU quota.","The smallgpu partition in the Gautschi cluster seems appropriate for the Doctoral Candidate's use case as it provides shared resources for all groups with an allocation on the community cluster. Jobs ran via this partition do not subtract from the group's AI GPU balance. To submit to the smallgpu partition, use the option ""-p smallgpu"" or ""--partition=smallgpu"". When using this partition, jobs are tagged by the ""normal"" QOS by default, and there is no need to specify a QOS. The smallgpu partition has 6 Gautschi-G nodes, each containing two NVIDIA L40s and two Zen 4 AMD EPYC 9554 64-core processors for a total of 128 cores and 384GB of memory. Memory in this partition is allocated proportional to the number of GPUs used, and core requests should be proportionate to the number of GPUs being used. There is no charge against the group's GPU quota when using the smallgpu partition. The full documentation for the Gautschi cluster can be found at [Gautschi Documentation](URL)."

403744,Consolidating two research queues for GPU servers?,"User needs to consolidate two dedicated A-100 GPUs (one from each cluster N and K) into a single queue (say ychu-n) in order to run distributed ML jobs on the GPUs at the same time. The user's research requires both GPUs to be on the same node with NVLink connectivity, as the cluster K does not have this feature.","To consolidate the dedicated A-100 GPUs into a single queue (ychu-n), the user's K GPU will be moved to an N GPU, but not vice versa due to different GPU capacities and current unavailability of K GPUs for replacement. To ensure the 2 GPUs are on the same node:
   - Add `--nodes=1` or `-N1` as a Slurm option to your job submission script. - Also add `--gpus-per-node=2` to your job submission script, which will cause the job to run on 2 GPUs within the same node. This is not guaranteed to always place both GPUs on the same physical node, but it increases the likelihood of it happening. For more information and details about Slurm options, please refer to the [Slurm documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html)."

764027,Unable to Recreate Conda Environment Due to Network Issue on Gautschi or Gilbreth,PhD student cannot recreate Conda environment due to network-related issues preventing access to required Conda repositories on RCAC systems.,"The user can utilize a temporary proxy setup for Conda as a workaround until the permanent fix is in place: `HTTPS_PROXY=squid.rcac.purdue.edu:3128 (Example, HTTPS_PROXY=squid.rcac.purdue.edu:3128 conda install xxx )`. For further details on using the AI partition with GPUs on Gautschi, refer to this section of the [Gautschi guide](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/gautschi/run/slurm/queues) or the relevant portion pasted below:

When using the AI partition, jobs are tagged by the ""normal"" QOS by default, but they can be tagged with the ""preemptible"" QOS if explicitly submitted using the ""-q preemptible"" or ""--qos=preemptible"" option. Jobs tagged with the ""normal"" QOS are subject to the following policies:
- Jobs have a high priority and should not need to wait very long before starting. The account the job is submitted to will be charged 1 GPU hour for each GPU this job uses per hour (this is tracked by the minute). These jobs can run for up to two weeks at a time. Jobs tagged with the ""preemptible"" QOS subject to the following policies:
- Jobs have a low priority and there is no expectation of job start time. If the partition is very busy with jobs using the ""normal"" QOS or if you are requesting a very large job, then jobs using the ""standby"" QOS may take hours or days to start. The account the job is submitted to will be charged 0.25 GPU hour for each GPU this job uses per hour (this is tracked by the minute) which effectively allows jobs to use 4x as many resources as a job tagged with the ""normal"" qos for the same cost. These jobs can run for up to two weeks at a time. If there are not enough idle resources in this partition for a job tagged with the ""normal"" QOS to start, then this job may be cancelled to make room for that job. This means it is imperative to use checkpointing if using this QOS. Available QOSes: ""normal"", ""preemptible""."

492579,Connecting issue about Gilbreth,"The user is experiencing frequent disconnections from Gilbreth cluster while using VS Code, with the connection issue being temporarily resolved by deleting the .vscode-server folder but recurring shortly after. The user suspects they have exceeded their storage limit and seeks to check their current allocation and increase it if possible.","- To check your disk quota, run the following command: `quota`. This will display the disk space usage for both the current directory and the user's account as a whole. - Unfortunately, there is no way to increase your disk quota on Gilbreth cluster. If you have files that you only need temporarily, it is recommended to store them in scratch storage: https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/gilbreth/storage/options/scratch
   - Alternatively, delete files that are no longer needed to free up space. You can use the following command to find and remove large files: `name -sh . ?? * * | sort -rh | head`. It will list directories and files taking up the most storage, starting from the largest. Be sure to only delete files you no longer require, as permanent deletion cannot be undone. - To avoid hitting the storage limit while running code, it may be helpful to redirect output to a file in your scratch directory using commands like `>` or `>>`. For example: `my_script > my_output.txt`. This will save the output to the specified file instead of keeping it locally. - Be mindful of the size of your output files and regularly delete them after processing is complete to avoid exceeding storage limits."

However, if the user is not a manager on the group, they likely won't be able to access that tab. The lab's Depot is using the default permissions configuration which is described here: https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/depot/permissions/default. To set permissions that are more restrictive than the default configuration, a group manager would need to create a new directory via the group management page and assign a unix group to it (https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/depot/permissions/unixgroups). Permissions on Depot can't be managed with traditional Linux commands like 'chmod' or 'chown'. It is recommended against layering permissions as it causes a headache for the lab's group managers when trying to find which directories have special permissions. If the PI sets the user as a group manager, they could go over this together to get something setup."

613827,[Account: bera89-k] 2/3 nodes available on Gilbreth,"Job with QOSGrpGRES reason has been waiting in the SLURM queue for a while, while other jobs submitted later have started running; Seeking clarification about what 'GRES limit' refers to and how to ensure true FIFO queue","The term 'GRES' refers to General Resources in SLURM. In this context, the 'GRES limit' is the maximum amount of general resources (such as number of CPUs or GPUs) that a specific job queue can consume at any given time. To ensure a true FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue, you should consider adjusting your job requirements to match the available resources in your cluster, particularly if they are limited. This will allow more jobs to start running in order of their submission time. You can adjust job requirements using the '--gres' option when submitting jobs with sbatch or srun commands. For example:

```bash
sbatch --gres=gpu:1 your_job_script.sh
```
In this example, the command specifies that the job requires one GPU for its execution. Adjusting the number of requested resources will help to ensure a more efficient scheduling and minimize queue time for jobs. For further information about using SLURM, consult the official documentation at: [SLURM User Guide](https://slurm.schedmd.com/userguide/index.html)"

659363,Dear RCAC,"User has two issues: Quota limit warning in Bell interactive page despite no longer being a member of depot/guo675, and an issue using Spyder in Gilbreth cluster with environment '$HOME/MyEnvG0'.","- For the quota limit warning, it may take a few days for the system to fully update due to the user no longer being a member of depot/guo675. In the meantime, we recommend monitoring your usage and contacting RCAC Support if necessary. For the quota usage not capturing $HOME, this is expected behavior as it only reports the quota usage for project directories under the user's home directory, not the home directory itself. - Regarding Spyder in Gilbreth cluster, since reinstalling Spyder doesn't seem to solve the issue within the desired environment, we suggest trying the following steps:
     1. Activate your environment '$HOME/MyEnvG0' by running `source ~/MyEnvG0/bin/activate`. 2. Check that Spyder is installed with the command `which spyder`; if not, install it using the command `conda install -c anaconda spyder`. 3. If you have a specific configuration or saved projects in '$HOME/MyEnvG0' that you want to use with Spyder, consider creating a link from your new environment to those files using the command `ln -s /path/to/your/saved/project /path/to/new/environment`. 4. If necessary, add the path for the 'spyder' executable to your PATH variable within the activated environment by modifying the ~/.bashrc file in your new environment and adding `export PATH=$PATH:~/MyEnvG0/bin`. 5. After making these changes, deactivate and reactivate the environment with the commands `deactivate` followed by `source ~/MyEnvG0/bin/activate`. You should now be able to use Spyder in your desired environment without losing previously installed packages or project data."

In the meantime, the staff recommends the following steps for creating a conda environment (adapted from the Jupyter kernel creation instruction):
   - Open a terminal/command prompt. - Navigate to the desired location (e.g., /depot/gdsp/apps). - Run the command ""conda create --name FourCastNetPy jupyter"" to create a new conda environment called FourCastNetPy with Jupyter installed. - Activate the environment using ""source activate FourCastNetPy"". - Install additional packages as needed, such as Gilbreth: ""conda install -c bioconda gilbreth"". - Once done, use the command ""conda-env-mod create --prefix /depot/gdsp/apps/FourCastNetPy --no-build"" to specify the prefix location and disable package build within the environment. - After creating the environment, you can start the Jupyter notebook using ""jupyter notebook"". - For more information on conda commands, consult the [Conda User Guide](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)."
