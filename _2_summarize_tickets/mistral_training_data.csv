Hello, Are you aware that depot is down? I cannot connect. dan ________________ name name 226 WSLR 494-8092
Hello, There was a brief power outage across campus that took many services offline. Most Research services were inaccessible due to a resulting networking outage yesterday morning. At this time, Brown and Halstead remain offline as their scratch systems are still being restored. Most other Research resources were not affected by the power outage other than being unreachable due to the larger network outage during the morning. General information: https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/news/1270 Halstead and Brown information: https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/news/1271 Note: Halstead and Brown scratch purging has been canceled for this week. We apologize for not responding through the ticketing system yesterday, but the ITaP ticketing system was offline all day. We did try to respond directly to emails so this may be a redundant email for you, but we want to make sure everyone gets a reply. I will close this ticket, but please let us know if you see any lingering issues. name

Dear IT officer, I am running the Matlab code in the conte. Usually I use this command to run the Matlab code interactively. qsub -I -l nodes=1:ppn=16,walltime=4:00:00 -q standby -X But after running one script code, it shows out of memory. Would you please help me figure out this issue? How can I request the memory? Thank you very much. Best wishes, name
Hi name, Your request does seem like you should be getting the whole node. Do you know how much memory you need, or how much memory this is using when it dies? If you have a job ID, I could look it up for you. I do see two recent jobs of yours on Conte which requested about 58GB of memory each. Since Conte nodes only have about 62GB available, including for system processes, these may have died. In general, jobs like you describe should have access to all the memory the node has, but if your job tries to use more than that, there's nothing we can do. Conte nodes only have about 60GB of usable physical memory. Hope that helps. Let me know! Thanks, - name
Haven't heard anything, so I'm closing this out. If that's in error, just reply to this message and it should re-open. Thanks, - name 
","1. Issue Summary: The user is experiencing an ""out of memory"" error when running a Matlab script on a computing node using the command `qsub -I -l nodes=1:ppn=16,walltime=4:00:00 -q standby -X`. The issue arises because the script is likely consuming more memory than the node can provide, which is approximately 60GB of usable physical memory.

2. Resolution: The user should first determine the exact memory requirements of their Matlab script. If the script requires more memory than a single node can provide, the user may need to optimize the script to use less memory or consider splitting the task into smaller parts. Alternatively, if the infrastructure allows, the user could request access to a node with more memory, if available. The user should also monitor the memory usage during execution to ensure it stays within the limits of the node's capacity. "

Hi, I have a problem with download my results from starch. Brown My data is quite big , some of them over 1T. I have tried to download them but it always been interrupt somehow. ( I think that might be the problem with two factor authentication) I got a message that some of my files will be deleted by next week. I usually use cyber duck to connect the sever. Is there any better way to access the sever for downloading? Or Can you be able to extant the expiration of my files? name name Ph.D. Candidate Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering Purdue University
Hi  name, Where are you trying to download your results? Does the destination have enough space to fit them? I suspect the interruptions could be momentary network glitches (secure shell based protocols like SCP and SFTP are very sensitive to this, and even an instantaneous network glitch would cause them to re-establish connection and re-authenticate). Our clusters support multiple transfer methods - see https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/brown/storage/transfer/ for a list. For reliability and stability (especially for larger-size data), I would highly recommend Globus (it is generally more performant, and also much more robust even on flaky networks). Thanks, name P.S. I have asked our storage admins to skip purging of your scratch files during the next run (Tuesday, December 15). Regular purging will resume the following week on December 22. Hopefully this should give you enough time to archive your data. -- name name ITaP Research Computing (RCAC) 
","1. Issue Summary: The user is experiencing interruptions while attempting to download large data files, some over 1TB, from a server using Cyberduck. They suspect that two-factor authentication might be causing the issue. Additionally, there is concern about the impending deletion of files from the server.

2. Resolution: The support team suggested that the interruptions might be due to network glitches, which can affect secure shell-based protocols like SCP and SFTP. They recommended using Globus for data transfer, as it is more reliable and robust, especially for large files and unstable networks. The support team also arranged for the storage administrators to delay the purging of the user's files, providing additional time to download and archive the data. The user was directed to a link (https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/brown/storage/transfer/) for more information on available transfer methods."

Hi, My name is name and i am a graduate student in Dr. name name group. A lot of us have observed recently that a lot of times users put in single node less than 20 ppn jobs on standby queue (some time just using 4-8 ppn). This effectively just makes all the other processors on the node ineffective. We also thought that users might be doing so for large memory requirement jobs but that is rarely the case and a lot of times these jobs use very less memory. Also, a majority of times these jobs are submitted in a huge number and as they require much less resources, I have seen a lot of times that they run before a lot of ours which usually are over multiple nodes. This has significantly increased our queue times in the past 1-2 months and sometimes jobs take over 1-2 days to start on the standby queue. Kindly let us know a solution to this problem. Thanks name
It's a good observation - thanks for bringing up your concerns. I hate to see cores go to waste, so to speak, but it's hard to see the full picture. It may be that their jobs are very IO intensive - which is hard to see from something like 'top' - or it may be that their jobs only briefly use lots of memory (also hard to see from momentary glances at 'top'), or there may be some other resource contention they are trying to avoid. It may also simply be that they are not aware that the default scheduling policy is 'singlejob' to where they are only getting a single job per node and they could benefit from policies that allow multiple jobs per node. Figuring out which is the case is difficult though. In short, we try not to get into people's jobs and dictate what they should be allocating. If we see someone who is doing something that is disruptive to other users we will step in and consult with the user to improve their job submissions. Keep in mind we place no guarantees on turnaround time in standby queue - and it's hard to predict what wait times should even be at a particular time. We have fairshare scheduling policies in place on standby so that priorities are sorted based on how much time a person in standby uses - so if someone is making inefficient submissions, they'll see a penalty in priority. This also helps those who only submit the occasional standby job and should prevent those people from getting stuck behind someone who submits 100s of standby jobs continuously. Hope this helps. name
","1. Issue Summary: The user reported that many jobs submitted to the standby queue are using fewer processors per node than available, leading to inefficient use of resources and increased queue times for their group's jobs. They noted that these jobs often do not require large memory and are submitted in large numbers, causing delays for multi-node jobs.

2. Resolution: The response explained that while the situation is understood, it is challenging to determine the exact reasons for such job submissions without further investigation. The system has fairshare scheduling policies to manage priorities based on usage, which should help balance the queue. If a user's submissions are found to be disruptive, the IT support team will consult with them to improve their job submissions. There are no guarantees on turnaround times in the standby queue, but the policies in place aim to prevent inefficiencies and ensure fair access."

Dear RCAC, I'm teaching a graduate elective on DFT calculations this semester, and I'd like for my class to have access to Surveyor so that they can do some basic calculations.Â  Is it possible to arrange for that to happen?Â  The course is CHE 697, Advanced Modeling for Catalysis Studies.Â  There are currently 22 students registered. Thanks, name name
name, Can you please send a link to the software? I cannot find a link to download/user guide. Is this a licensed software? Regards, name 
Hi name, We will probably use GPAW for the class since it's open source (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/).Â  Do you think that that will be a problem? name On 1/22/2019 12:36 PM, Purdue Customer Support wrote: > [Duplicate message snipped]

If ""Surveyor"" is an ECN machine, then this request would need to go to ECN. Kindly let us know. Regards, name.

However, if you and your research group are interested to try working with Avizo, you should try to install it into your group's Data Depot space. Members of our team can probably help you to build and compile the software if you get into trouble. Please let us know what you would like to do. name

Hello, Since a couple of days I am not able to reach https://oculus.rcac.purdue.edu/ganglia Could you please check whether the service is available? Thanks, name_____ name name, PhD Research Assistant Professor School of Electrical and Computer Engineering Network for Computational Nanotechnology Purdue Center for Predictive Materials and Devices 207 S Martin Jischke Drive Purdue University, DLR, room 131-1C West Lafayette, Indiana 47907-1971 phone:  fax:  www.tkubis.com<http://www.tkubis.com>; www.group.tkubis.com<http://www.group.tkubis.com>
Hello name, Unfortunately, the behavior that you are observing is due to a recently-addressed vulnerability that was reported in Ganglia. The version has been updated, and more restrictive firewall rules have been put in place. Please let me know if you have further questions. Regards, name
name, To add on we may have something better though. This tool is very new and not fully advertised yet but we have a new job usage reporting tool: https://xdmod.rcac.purdue.edu/ With this tool, we collect general job usage statistics, and very detailed metrics very similar to what you saw in Ganglia, I believe. If you go to that page, click the login button at the top, and then go to the Job Viewer tab. There is a search button where you can search jobs by your username, save them to a search, and then view the results. I think you should be able to at least search your own jobs. Once you get logged in for the first time I can also designate you a PI for NCN so you should be able to view other NCN queue jobs as well. At the moment, there is only data from Brown, BrownGPU, Halstead, and Rice. We'll be getting Snyder as we upgrade it next week. I am not completely sure about HalsteadGPU and Conte, but I'm sure we will roll this out to them in time. Let me know if you have any questions - I am still learning this tool, so this will be a learning experience for both of us. name Hi, Thanks for the information. I have logged into xdmod and tried to find the information I looked for: One of my calculations is running beyond the available memory of the machine. I try to understand the timing and pattern in which the calculation increases the memory. Ganglia is extremely easy to use for that purpose. In xdmod, I failed to find this information so far. XDmod seems to rather be a usage log tool, instead of a resource monitor. I found that ganglia can be reached via the thinlink. Is that the only way? Â name, name Â  From: Purdue Customer Support  Â Sent: Friday, May 18, 2018 6:17 PM Â To: name, name C Â Subject: Customer Notice about ganglia not accessible ISSUE=935081 PROJ=17 Â  [Duplicate message snipped] 
Yes, I believe the firewall has it restricted to the research network, so a web browser on a front-end would probably work. Thanks for the feedback. name
","1. Issue Summary: The user reported being unable to access the Ganglia service at the provided URL, suspecting it might be unavailable. They were informed that the service was restricted due to a vulnerability, and a new tool, XDmod, was suggested as an alternative. However, the user found XDmod insufficient for their needs, as it did not provide the same resource monitoring capabilities as Ganglia. They inquired if Ganglia could be accessed through any other means.

2. Resolution: The user was informed that the Ganglia service is restricted to the research network due to updated firewall rules. It was suggested that accessing it via a web browser on a front-end might work. The user was also provided with information about the new XDmod tool, although it did not fully meet their requirements for resource monitoring."

Hello, I'd like to build a code using GNU C++ compiler (I need to test something). In addition, I'd like to use MKL lapack calls. I know this is possible, I have done it on my own workstation. On RCAC computers there are modules. Question: can I load gcc module and use MKL by specifying correct path to MKL? Will the MKL directories be accessible without loading modules for Intel compilers? Thank you, name.
Greetings, name, It should be possible to use the MKL with g++ by setting the values for the MKLROOT (and possibly MKL_HOME) environment variables to those used by the Intel compiler module. I'd say ""module load"" the version of the Intel module that has the MKL you want, grab the values for those variables, ""module load"" the version of GCC you want, then setenv the variables. After that, you should be able to use compiler flags similar to what you used to compile on your workstation. I'll leave this ticket open so you have a means to respond whether this worked or not. :-) Thanks, name name HPC Systems Engineer 
","1. Issue Summary: The user wants to build code using the GNU C++ compiler and utilize MKL LAPACK calls on RCAC computers. They are inquiring if they can load the GCC module and access MKL without loading Intel compiler modules.

2. Resolution: It is possible to use MKL with the GNU C++ compiler by setting the MKLROOT (and possibly MKL_HOME) environment variables to those used by the Intel compiler module. The suggested approach is to load the Intel module to obtain the necessary environment variable values, then load the desired GCC module and set the environment variables accordingly. This should allow the user to use similar compiler flags as on their workstation. "

I use Bell cluster and launch ANSYS Fluent with Ã¢ÂÂsinteractive -A standby -N 1 -n 64 -t 04:00:00 module load ansys fluentÃ¢ÂÂ Then I load the case file and open Fluent, the following warning message occurred. Opening Fluent become very slow and it took about 20 minutes. This issue did not happen on Brown cluster. It seems to be the graphics card issue. Could you please help to solve this issue ? Thank you very much ! name -- name name Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University Research assistant in Ray W. Herrick Laboratories Phone:  Email1
name, can you try ""fluent -driver opengl"" when you launch? Best, name 
Hello name, Thank you for your reply ! Using ""fluent -driver opengl"" works ! I have another question. What if I first use Ã¢ÂÂrunwb2Ã¢ÂÂ to launch ANSYS workbench, then open fluent as a component in workbench, how to avoid the similar issue ? I found that Ã¢ÂÂrunwb2 -driver openglÃ¢ÂÂ cannot work with Ã¢ÂÂUnknown command line option openglÃ¢ÂÂ error. Thank you very much ! name On 1/11/2021 2:53 PM, Purdue Customer Support wrote: > [Duplicate message snipped] 
name, -driver is the option of fluent, but not runwb2. That's the reason for the issue. You may set the an environment variable before launching runwb2 ( i.e. type ""export HOOPS_PICTURE=opengl"" in your terminal before typing ""runwb2""). Please let me know if that helps. Best, name
Dear name, ""export HOOPS_PICTURE=opengl"" works ! The problem is solved. Thank you very much for your help ! Kind regards, name On 1/13/2021 12:04 PM, Purdue Customer Support wrote: > [Duplicate message snipped] 
","1. Issue Summary: The user experienced a warning message and significant slowdown when opening Fluent on the Bell cluster, suspecting it to be a graphics card issue. When attempting the workaround of using ""fluent -driver opengl,"" it worked, but they encountered an issue when trying to use ""runwb2 -driver opengl"" which resulted in an ""Unknown command line option opengl"" error.

2. Resolution: The support team advised the user that ""-driver"" is an option for Fluent but not for ""runwb2."" Instead, they instructed the user to set an environment variable by typing ""export HOOPS_PICTURE=opengl"" before launching ""runwb2."" "

I have a number of jobs running on the physics queue on Hammer, and I am unable to see the current output using qpeek. The job ids are 1634359-1634383, and whenever I run qpeek I get the message `Connection closed by 128.211.146.102` or 128.211.146.91, depending on the job. I tried to connect to one of those two nodes via ssh and got the exact same `Connection closed` result. If I run checkjob it gives most of the usual info but also returns `ERROR: cannot establish connection (hostname:port=hammer-adm:42560)`. Also, (if it matters) these jobs will run out of walltime at approximately 10:30am today. Thanks, name name

When attempting to use qpeek, the user receives a ""Connection closed by"" error message from specific IP addresses. Additionally, attempts to connect via SSH result in the same connection issue. The checkjob command provides most information but also returns an error stating it cannot establish a connection with hammer-adm on a specific port. The jobs are expected to run out of walltime at approximately 10:30am.

2. Resolution: A configuration error on the nodes was identified as the cause for qpeek failing. A fix has been implemented, but it will take a few hours to propagate to all the nodes."

name, this is the current list of failed system disks in the CMS cluster, that need to be replaced with the recently purchased SSDs. cms-h001 - missing 1 system disk cms-h003 - missing both system disks cms-h004 - missing 1 system disk cms-h006 - 1 system disk failing right now cms-i001 - 1 system disk failed The system disks on those chassis are in the back. Some are easy to identify by the amber/flashing LED. But maybe not all. Please - let us know when it s not possible to identify them, so that we can help remotely. It is probably best to start with cms-h003 which is missing both system disks, and is therefore out of service at the moment. The rest of the systems in the list are online, so any reboots/interruptions should be synchronized with us. - Stefan
I have replaced the disks on cms-h001, 3, and 4. cms-h006 doesn't have a failing system disk, but a data disk (slot 3 / 4TB). cms-i001 appears hold the system drives interally, as there's only 36 external slots, and there's 36 data disks on the system. Please let me know when I can shut down the system to replace that drive. Note that the new disks are only 120GB, smaller than the old disks, so you may need to reinstall to use them on the systems that I only replaced one disk on. name name  ITaP Data Center Managemnt 
Please see other ticket about cms-i001. All other disks have been replaced, so I'm closing this ticket. name name Data Center Architect ITaP Data Center Management 
","1. Issue Summary: The CMS cluster had multiple failed system disks that needed replacement with newly purchased SSDs. The identified issues included missing or failing system disks on the following hosts: cms-h001 (1 missing system disk), cms-h003 (both system disks missing), cms-h004 (1 missing system disk), cms-h006 (1 system disk incorrectly reported as failing, the actual issue was a data disk failure), and cms-i001 (1 failed system disk internal to the system, with external slots fully populated with data disks).

2. Resolution:  The failed system disks on cms-h001, cms-h003, and cms-h004 were replaced. It was identified that cms-h006 had a failing data disk rather than a system disk. For cms-i001, further actions are required and discussed in a separate ticket, as the system needs to be shut down for the disk replacement. It was noted that the new SSDs are smaller in capacity (120GB), indicating a potential need for system reinstallations where only one disk was replaced."

Hi, Ive been trying to sync large amounts of data between Gilbreth and Brown clusters, but Im encountering inconsistent transfer speeds and occasional timeout errors when using rsync. I've tried adjusting the options and flags with no success. Can you recommend a better method or tool for these transfers? Im open to using Globus if thats better. Thanks, name
Hi name, For large-scale transfers between RCAC clusters, we strongly recommend using Globus. It is much more robust for large datasets and handles retries and fault tolerance better than rsync. You can find our Globus documentation here: https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/globus. Please set up your Globus endpoints on Gilbreth and Brown and try the transfer again. Let us know if you run into any issues.
Since we havent heard back from you, well tentatively mark this ticket as resolved. You may reopen it within 7 days if further assistance is needed.
